# Dissertation backlog


### Must
- [ ] Write emails to Marc, Michelle, and Cole.
- [ ] Send!

### Should
- [ ] Tweak block quote indentation
- [ ] Remove empty space at the top of some pages (e.g. 107)
- [ ] Slightly extend acknowledgement to mom and Andreas.

### Could
- [ ] change repetitive “as well as” in bio to “a translator *and* a poet
- [ ] Put Bénabou in the right order. (Requires installing Unicode collation with pandoc.)
- [ ] Remove double quotes around title on Dedeo (in MLA).
- [ ] Cite Keats, “The Eve of St. Agnes” from a more reliable source (e.g. Poems & Letters)
- [ ] Cite Donne, “The Computation,” by itself (since Johnson does not technically cite it).
- [ ] Add name in brackets for McCarty if needed (53). (Although it is technically correct MLA).

- [ ] Add books mentioned in Dickinson footnote to bibliography
- [ ] Add footnote on Agamben and Calvino
- [ ] Make sure every article in bibliography has an URL or DOI.
- [ ] (e.g. Add URL for Scott Pound article)

- [ ] Remove Davenport from biblio if deemed unnecessary
      (as the container-author field doesn’t appear correctly.)
- [ ] Add page number to inline Calvino quote re: Carlo Levi (“tangled”).
(Difficult to do without the Italian, and the block quote gives a page number, which is probably the same.)

### Won’t
- [ ] Add in-text reference for OED potential citation
- [ ] Add Donne, The Computation
- [ ] Add specific reference to Pound/Fenollosa
- [ ] Add bibliographic entry for Phillips, A Humament (only mentioned)

- [ ] Add page number for chrononormativity in Freeman
- [ ] Add Eliot, epigram to the Wasteland (“il miglior fabbro”)
- [ ] Make it clear that Valéry is cited in Baetens and Poucel
      (Or add direct reference to Valéry: not needed: “sympathy for the return to order”)
- [ ] Consider adding reference for Marvell, “ye living lamps”
- [ ] Coleridge citation? Otherwise change to ctd. in Starnino.
- [ ] Add page number to second Ngai instance re: stuplimity.
- [ ] Consider adding *Drift*, since you mention it
- [ ] Consider adding line numbers to Bergvall
- [ ] Consider finding a better Virgil translation. Or lineate.
- [ ] Consider quoting Chun in Calvino chapter rather than just referencing.
- [ ] Disambiguate McLaughlin if you add the *other* McLaughlin (which you don’t, so forget about it)
- [ ] Disambiguate Johnson references (because *Hyperboles* is in bibliography)
- [ ] Consider adding (Place and Fitterman 11) note in Bergvall to help locate text
      in bibliography (although the preface is written by Fitterman ...)

- [ ] Add line numbers to poetry citations after block quotes (e.g. with Bervin and Shakespeare on p. 145).
- [ ] Find whatever you meant by Magné, “Tentative” (re: food in Perec)
- [ ] Consider altering summary of Bartlebooth on 145 (or your earlier summary).
      Repetitive.

- [ ] Finish reading Derrida on the stranger
- [ ] Retranslate Belacqua passage (“What good would it do to go up?”)
- [ ] Add a footnote on *The Poetry of Sound* to Bergvall chapter
- [ ] Consider extending the Calvino chapter:
      could you spin out the chessboard scene’s connections
      to other moments in the book?
- [ ] Give more close readings of *Eunoia*
- [ ] Consider adding a footnote on César Aira in Calvino chapter
- [ ] Add a pun in the section on “The Not Tale” re: tally (a tale, or a tally [113])
