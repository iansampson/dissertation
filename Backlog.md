# Dissertation backlog


### Must

### Should
- [ ] Add page number for Bellos on 145.
- [ ] Add citation of Swift Standard Library
- [ ] Fix Pages bookstore citation on 169.

- [ ] Put Bénabou in the right order. (Requires installing Unicode collation with pandoc.)

---

### Could
- [ ] Cite Keats, “The Eve of St. Agnes” from a more reliable source (e.g. Poems & Letters)
- [ ] Cite Donne, “The Computation,” by itself (since Johnson does not technically cite it).
- [ ] Add name in brackets for McCarty if needed (53). (Although it is technically correct MLA).

- [ ] Tweak block quote indentation
- [ ] Remove empty space at the top of some pages (e.g. 107)

- [ ] Slightly extend acknowledgement to mom and Andreas.

- [ ] Add books mentioned in Dickinson footnote to bibliography
- [ ] Add footnote on Agamben and Calvino
- [ ] Make sure every article in bibliography has an URL or DOI.
- [ ] (e.g. Add URL for Scott Pound article)

- [ ] Remove Davenport from biblio if deemed unnecessary
      (as the container-author field doesn’t appear correctly.)
- [ ] Add page number to inline Calvino quote re: Carlo Levi (“tangled”).
(Difficult to do without the Italian, and the block quote gives a page number, which is probably the same.)

### Won’t
- [ ] Add line numbers to poetry citations after block quotes (e.g. with Bervin and Shakespeare on p. 145).
- [ ] Find whatever you meant by Magné, “Tentative” (re: food in Perec)
- [ ] Consider altering summary of Bartlebooth on 145 (or your earlier summary).
      Repetitive.
- [ ] Consider reading Juan Luis Martínez’ *La nueva novela*
      (Read it when the dissertation is done.)
- [ ] Add footnote on digital poetry.
- [ ] Do all the things listed in your other to do lists.
- [ ] Browse articles on “The Knight’s Tale”
- [ ] Finish reading Derrida on the stranger
- [ ] Retranslate Belacqua passage (“What good would it do to go up?”)
- [ ] Add a footnote on *The Poetry of Sound* to Bergvall chapter
- [ ] Consider extending the Calvino chapter:
      could you spin out the chessboard scene’s connections
      to other moments in the book?
- [ ] Give more close readings of *Eunoia*
- [ ] Consider adding a footnote on César Aira in Calvino chapter
- [ ] Add a pun in the section on “The Not Tale” re: tally (a tale, or a tally [113])
