# Introduction: On Potential Literature

Imagine a text that can be summed up in a sentence. Imagine a list, for example, that contains everything the author ate and drank for a year, organized by food group and tabulated by quantity, down to the last bottle of Calvados or raspberry sorbet. Imagine a story about sixty-four cities – all of them imaginary (and suspiciously alike) – that together form the grid of an elaborate game of chess. Imagine a book of poetry in which each chapter uses only a single English vowel, weaving a perfectly grammatical epic out of words like *parallax*, *belvedere*, *gingivitis*, or *monochord*. Imagine a different sort of list, this time alphabetical, that contains every English-language translation of the first tercet of Dante’s *Commedia*, a list whose digressions and repetitions mirror the pilgrim’s bewilderment at finding himself lost, again, in the middle of a dark wood. Imagine a book that takes Shakespeare’s Sonnets and erases all but a handful of words, forging a new poem out of those that remain, enclosed within the whitespace left by those that do not. Imagine a text – to push the hyperbole a little further – you can grasp purely as a concept, a poem you can deduce from its title, a book you can enjoy without turning a single page.[^summaries] I say *hyperbole* because all of the examples described above – Georges Perec’s “Tentative d’inventaire des aliments liquides et solides que j’ai ingurgité au cours de l’année mil neuf cent soixante-quatorze,” Italo Calvino’s *Città invisibili*, Christian Bök’s *Eunoia*, Caroline Bergvall’s “Via,” and Jen Bervin’s *Nets* – are also brilliant works of literature that invite and reward close reading, pushing back against the constraints that govern their composition. I begin by playing devil’s advocate, however, indulging what Cleanth Brooks might call “the heresy of paraphrase” (192), in order to gesture towards the powerful mythos that surrounds writing of this kind: the notion that a literary work could, in theory, be reduced to an abstraction, an epitome so minimal and attenuated, so bereft of rhetorical artifice or affective texture, that it might as well not be read (or written) at all. Hyperbolic as it may be, this vision of a literature *in potentia*, appealing to the mind more than to the senses, to a “thinkership” more than to a “readership,”[^thinkership] continues to animate pressing debates in poetry studies and elsewhere, as the following pages will make clear, around the perceived waning of literary value and readerly attention in our post-medium age.[^post-medium]
<!---One could just as easily imagine a potential text that remains unwritten: the isopangram, for example, is straightforward enough – a sentence that uses each of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet only once – and yet no poet to date has succeeded in composing one.--> 

<!--Unlike the laws of natural language or social convention (and more like the generic laws of the sonnet or the sestina), constraints are self-chosen and self-imposed, furnishing writers with readymade structures for their work that are as generative as they are restrictive: the act of excluding certain words (all those that contain the letter *a*, for example) also throws those that remain into greater relief.-->
<!--And this constraint serves in turn (as the examples above attempt to demonstrate) as a succinct epitome, a definitive gloss, that precedes and conditions our apprehension of the text itself – to the point where one can imagine reading them without turning a single page.-->

<!--To make a short recapitulation: strictly speaking, a constraint is a self-chosen rule (i.e., different from the rules that are imposed by the use of a natural language or those of convention); it is also a rule that is used systematically throughout the work (its range therefore differs from that of style, which is less systematic), both as a compositional and as a reading device. Constraints are not ornaments: for the writer, they help generate the text; for the reader, they help make sense of it. Accordingly, rigorously applied constraints are explicitly definable and verifiable in a textual analysis. (613-4)-->

<!---To call such forms of literature *potential* is to acknowledge that a constraint, once formulated, already encompasses all the ways it could possibly be exemplified. In this strict sense, potential literature is not literature at all, but the possibility of literature – and this possibility (even or especially when it is left unrealized) carries an aesthetic value that no extant text can exhaust.-->

I owe the phrase *potential literature* to the Oulipo, or Ouvroir de Littérature Potentielle, a group of writers and mathematicians (among other eclectic trades) founded in 1960 by Raymond Queneau and François le Lionnais. I will say more about the Oulipo in a moment, although this dissertation is focused less on the group itself (which remains, despite its notoriety, more than a little reclusive) than on the diverse works it has inspired. I use *potential literature* (uncapitalized, unabbreviated) to encompass a corpus that is not, for the most part, officially sanctioned by the Oulipo, although certainly influenced by its signature techniques and by the work of its most accomplished members. I draw upon an archive that spans two continents and three languages – from the historical origins of the Oulipo in postwar Europe (with a focus on the late 1970s and early 1980s, when Perec and Calvino wrote their most celebrated novels) to the work of three contemporary poets, who, at the turn of the millennium, put the practice of *écriture sous contrainte* into dialogue with new forms and new genres occasioned by the rise of a rapidly digitizing culture. By reading these two moments alongside each other, I hope to show how potential literature – often dismissed as a marginal or even esoteric practice, insulated from the historical and social entanglements of other postwar avant-gardes – is deeply responsive to the new media of its time. From Calvino’s vision of an epigrammatic literature composed of “weightless bits” (*Lezioni* 10) to Bervin’s conceit of poetry as a form of artificial memory that can be endlessly erased and overwritten, this constellation of writers forges a powerful analogy between digital algorithms and literary constraints, addressing an epoch in which emergent forms of artificial intelligence seem poised to automate every facet of human endeavor.[^stiegler-automatic] To write under constraint is to embody a machine, subjecting oneself to procedures and routines that a robot might conceivably perform instead: Perec’s enumeration of his annual diet, for example, insists upon tabulating the exact quantity of each foodstuff he ingests, a practice that anticipates the modern use of biosensors (on the FitBit or Apple Watch, for example) to log a user’s every heartbeat or footfall, feeding a biopolitical regime that aggregates such data on a global scale in order to measure, optimize, and thereby govern the life of populations. By resituating this algorithmic logic within the domain of literature, however, and by carrying out programmatic tasks by hand, these writers also resist the lure of the digital by revealing its capacity for failure and error: Perec thwarts the veracity of his food diary at every turn by allowing taste – the most proximal of senses, the most bodily, and therefore the least susceptible to abstraction – to influence his tally. (After all, how can you reliably count how many bottles of wine you have drunk, if you are already drunk on wine?) Against the commonplace view of constraint-based writing as a cerebral or disembodied practice (a perfect compliment, some critics argue, to the sense of disaffected mastery and analytical poise endemic to contemporary techno-capitalism),[^oulipo-critics] my readings suggest on the contrary that potential literature, at least in the examples gathered here, foregrounds the embodied act of writing and its recalcitrance to routinization. In various genres and by various means, all of these writers resist the power of constraints to quantify the sensible world and to regulate the bodies that inhabit it. That the dissertation begins with taste is hardly incidental: all of the texts in question, despite their commitment to procedural abstraction, appeal viscerally to the reader’s senses. From Calvino’s baroque ekphrases of miniature objects to the monovalic feasts that embellish the chapters of *Eunoia*, the abundance of the sensible world refuses to bow to the laws of abstraction, striving as they do, with tireless precision, to reduce lived experience to computable data.

Read this way, potential literature offers a new perspective on some of the broader quandaries that beset the humanities in the digital age: How can the literary and the aesthetic – which place such a high value on contingency and indeterminacy, on those qualities of experience that no governing concept or analytical procedure can reduce to a definitive summary – endure in a world that is being programmed to bits? What forms of expression are still possible within a system that tracks even the most minute details of quotidian life, syncopating the movements of bodies and affects within a clockwork that leaves no room for error? Is our only recourse to embrace this algorithmic logic, as some digital humanists argue, harnessing the power of computers to summarize vast corpora of texts into graphs, maps, and trees that can be scanned at a glance?[^graphs] Potential literature, I argue, offers a less dystopian strategy: if new media strive to model sensible experience through statistical aggregates, these writers reverse the process, making the abstract structures at the heart of computation – the list, the set, the grid, the database – into rhetorical and literary forms. Forms, moreover, that are prone to failure: lists that overflow their bounds, catalogues that redound and digress, accrue here an affective charge, an aesthetic texture, that runs against the grain of the systems they are designed to exemplify. Potential literature opposes the digital fantasy of a wholly dematerialized world – where all our data dwell eternally in the cloud – by bending the rigid protocols of computation to the swerves and detours of literary expression.

<!---TODO: Add a more straightforward introduction to the Oulipo at the beginning of this next paragraph.-->
The notion that *écriture sous contrainte* offers a critical response to the threat of demediation, however, is not entirely new, and to grasp the longer arc of this narrative it is worth turning briefly to the origins of the Oulipo in postwar France – at a restaurant in Cerisy-la-Salle, to be precise, where, in November 1960, the group convened its inaugural session.[^early-oulipo] Originally named the Séminaire de Littérature Expérimentale (a subcommittee of the Collège de Pataphysique), the founding members swiftly took leave of this umbrella organization and dropped the term *Séminaire* (with its scholastic overtones, deemed to be too sterile, too *structuralist*) by their second meeting. (Queneau was the official scribe of Alexandre Kojève’s seminars on Hegel – in the company of Georges Batailles, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jacques Lacan – although he later sought to distance himself from the dominant strands of postwar French theory. In the Second Manifesto, François le Lionnais urges the reader not to confuse the group’s penchant for literary structures with structuralism proper – “a term that many of us consider with circumspection” [29].) And so the Ouvroir de Littérature Potentielle was born. Oulipo for short, giving each syllable of its triadic structure an equal semantic weight. *Ouvroir*: not just a workshop, but a workroom – originally denoting a wing of a convent where nuns assemble to do needlework, a sewing circle, a place of handicraft. (In his introduction to the *Oulipo Primer*, Warren Motte contrasts the word with *oeuvre*, which implies canonicity and consecration. The work of the *ouvroir* is more collective than individual, more artisanal than artistic, more laborious than inspired [9-10]). *Literature*: although the Oulipo has spawned numerous analogues in other media and other genres – the Oucuipo, for example, is the Workshop of Potential Cuisine – the group began as an exploration of the potentiality specific to literary and linguistic structures, from minute permutations of the alphabetic code (anagrams, lipograms, palindromes) to the epic scale of encyclopedic novels whose plots derive from the rules of chess. (Two such novels – Calvino’s *Città invisibili* and Perec’s *La vie mode d’emploi* – make an appearance in this dissertation.) The fact that literary texts are made primarily of letters (in the European tradition, at least) – and therefore constitute a discrete sequence that can be subdivided, inverted, and freely rearranged – inspires the early efforts of the Oulipo to formalize natural language and impose constraints that make literary texts precisely quantifiable: Perec’s 1969 novel *La Disparition*, for example, entirely omits words that contain the letter *e* – a fact that either a simple algorithm or an assiduous human could verify beyond doubt. (That early reviews overlook this obvious omission testifies to the masterful subtlety with which Perec carries out his constraint.) At the same time, the existing codification of literary (and especially poetic) genres, many of them deemed obsolete – the villanelle, the rondeau, the sonnet, among others – serves to legitimize the Oulipian project of reviving old forms and devising new ones.

<!---TODO: Consider adding a footnote with Poucel’s definition of constraint to the end of the following sentence.-->
This is the essential vocation of the group: to discover and to invent (*inventio*: to find again) constraints that can be used to craft literary texts – texts that would otherwise be unthinkable. And here we arrive at the third term, one that echoes throughout the Oulipo archive and proves the most difficult to pin down, a sort of *point de capiton* that sutures the Oulipo together and yet itself remains elusive. The [OED]{.smallcaps} defines *potential* as “[p]ossible as opposed to actual; having or showing the capacity to develop into something in the future; latent; prospective.” Derived from the Latin *potentia* – force, power, ability (although also, in ecclesiastical Latin, a crutch, a prosthesis), *potential* in this sense describes what something *can* do – whatever is possible, capacious, eventual – and directs itself toward a future when this latent possibility will finally be actualized. In this sense, potential is powerful, even violent – a taut bow, an unsprung trap – that befits its imperial etymon, “[p]ossessing potency or power; potent, powerful, mighty, strong; commanding.” But potential is also the absence of actuality. What is *possible* is not yet actual; what is latent is not yet manifest. Without this latency, potential is impotent: the sprung trap is no longer a threat. Potential is the abyss between capacity and act, between what something *can* do or be and the doing or being itself. Potential is therefore also the capacity *not* to do or *not* to be, to defer action indefinitely, remaining forever unactualized. To be potential is to be – at least for the time being – inactive, reticent, dormant.[^agamben-potential]

In his entry on *potential* in the *Oulipo Compendium*, Harry Matthews quotes the above definition from the [OED]{.smallcaps}, adding his own gloss:

> The last word of *Ouvroir de littérature potentielle* defines the specificity of the Oulipo. From its beginnings the group has insisted on the distinction between “created creations” (*créations créés*) and “creations that create” (*créations créantes*), to the benefit of the latter: it has been concerned not with literary works but with procedures and structures capable of producing them. When the first sonnet was written almost a thousand years ago, what counted most was not the poem itself but a new potentiality of future poems. Such potentialities are what the Oulipo invents or discovers. (“potential”)

Like many Oulipians, Matthews emphasizes the generative potential of constraints, their capacity to engender new poems in a yet undefined future. Whether focused on invention or discovery – what Le Lionnais calls the “synthetic” and the “analytic” modes of the Oulipo, proposing new constraints and reviving old ones – the impetus of the group is essentially productive and creative, furnishing writers with tools for constructing truly original works of literature (a rarity, the Oulipians often lament, in a literary world that seems to place little value on formal competence). At the core of this definition is the distinction between *créations créantes* and *créations créés*, between potential literature (or constraints that *could* be used to write literature) and literature proper (including literary texts written under constraint). According to its founders, the Oulipo *stricto sensu* concerns only the former, relegating the latter to what Warren Motte calls (echoing Le Lionnais) the “limbo of the ‘applied Oulipo’” (“Introduction” 12). (Although this limbo is also home to the group’s most distinguished works: the prize-winning novels of Perec and Calvino avowedly belong to the realm of applied constraint, not to the realm of pure potential. Had the Oulipo insisted too rigidly upon this technicality, refusing to count such works as its own, it may well have perished in obscurity.) Queneau echoes this distinction in his definition of potential:

> The word ‘potential’ concerns the very nature of literature, that is, fundamentally it’s less a question of literature strictly speaking than of supplying forms for the good use one can make of literature. We call potential literature the search for new forms and structures which may be used by writers in any way they see fit. (ctd. in Arnaud xiii)

Even as he distinguishes potential literature from “literature strictly speaking,” Queneau suggests that its aim consists of “supplying forms,” like moulds to be filled, for writers to use “in any way they see fit.” Constraints serve “the good use one can make of literature,” and potential – for all of its associations with absence and deferral – exists to be actualized. At the same time, however, Queneau gestures towards the obverse sense of the word by implying that potential literature is not properly literature at all, only something that could – in the right circumstances, in the right hands – *become* literature. Matthews, for his part, cedes that this becoming might never take place, that a work of potential literature might remain unactualized, unwritten: the isopangram, he observes, is straightforward enough – a sentence that uses each of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet only once – and yet no poet to date has succeeded in composing one (213). Other constraints have a vanishingly short half-life: Le Lionnais’ proposal for a one-letter poem can be repeated only twenty-six times. Despite their emphasis on literary creation, then, these definitions suggest that potential literature keeps something in reserve, that its potential is never completely (or irreversibly) actualized. It is for this reason, as David Levin Becker argues, that “no static definition of potential literature exists: it remains an ineffable ideal toward which members are free to work as they see fit, each beholden to his or her own fascinations and bugbears and biases” (23).

Among the many divergent attempts to define and delimit the Oulipo, however, there is one exemplary text that appears again and again – even though its own literary potential remains radically unrealized. Published by Éditions Gallimard in 1961, Queneau’s *Cent mille milliards de poèmes* is widely credited as the inaugural Oulipian text, one that, like its many successors, at first seems disarmingly simple: a sequence of ten sonnets, composed in a flippant yet charming sort of doggrel. Here is the first quatrain of the first sonnet (with an English translation by Stanley Chapman):

> | Le roi de la pampa retourne sa chemise
> | Pour la mettre à sécher aux cornes des taureaux
> | Le cornedbeef en boîte empeste la remise
> | Et fermentent de même et les cuirs et les peaux

> | Don Pedro from his shirt has washed the fleas
> | The bull’s horns ought to dry it like a bone
> | Old corned-beef’s rusty armor spreads disease
> | That suede ferments is not at all well known (1-4)

Between each of these lines is a dotted border, marked with a scissors glyph where the page is to be cut apart. With the loose lines still attached to the spine, the *Poèmes* become a sort of flip book that invites readers to construct their own sonnets, choosing one line at a time from among ten possible variants. (Queneau credits the idea to children’s books that allow their readers to assemble monsters by flipping segmented pages – selecting a head, a torso, and a pair of legs from the bodies of different imaginary creatures [“Poems” 14].) No matter how readers recombine the composite lines, the rules of the Petrarchan sonnet – meter, rhyme scheme, even, to some degree, the delicate balance between octet and sestet – remain intact (as do the rules of French grammar). This structure makes the *Poèmes* doubly potential: first, in the sense that the concept precedes and constrains the writing itself (a book of ten sonnets whose lines can all be interchanged); and second, in the sense that the book is, in the words of Calvino, “a machine for making sonnets” (*Literature Machine* 12), capable of generating a vast quantity of *possible* sonnets – 10^14^, to be exact, one hundred trillion (or, as in the French title, one hundred thousand billion). Queneau calculates that even the most dedicated bookworm – at the rate of one sonnet a minute, eight hours a day, two hundred days a year – would require almost two hundred million centuries to read them all.[^queneau-duration] Le Lionnais expands upon this sense of enormity in his postface to the work:

> Thanks to [its] technical superiority, the work you are holding in your hands represents, itself alone, a quantity of text far greater than everything man has written since the invention of writing, including popular novels, business letters, diplomatic correspondence, private mail, rough drafts thrown into the wastebasket, and graffiti. (ctd. in Motte, “Introduction” 3)

With a nod to Borges’ Library of Babel (structured by an analogous principle, containing every possible combination of the letters of the alphabet), Le Lionnais discerns in the *Poèmes* a form of information overload, a sublime excess of textual data that – like other mass media (and even more voluminous) – threatens to overwhelm our readerly senses. That this vast archive fits comfortably into the reader’s hands – a “technical superiority,” as Le Lionnais puts it – anticipates our own digital moment when just about “everything man has written since the invention of writing” can indeed be squeezed onto a pocket-sized device. Like digital text (which is typically stored as a sequence of 8-bit Unicode characters, a binary code that can be endlessly permuted and recombined), the *Poèmes* achieves its peculiar density by atomizing the sonnet into its component lines, a set of discrete units whose possible combinations exceed by many orders of magnitude the space they occupy in their physical medium. Like an anagram (or Borges’ Library, for that matter), the potentiality of the *Poèmes* emerges in part from this combinatoric structure, whose minimal units – letters for Borges, lines for Queneau –  already implicitly contain all their possible orderings. At the same time, however, this potential is fated to remain unrealized: no reader (no human reader, at least) could ever devour the work in its entirety. Queneau anticipates a post-human future when the efficiency of machine readers (already nascent in the early 1960s in the form of automated punchcards) threatens to render human reading obsolete – a future where text is produced and consumed on a radically inhuman scale. Le Lionnais suggests that this future is already here: the *Poèmes* enter into an assemblage of ephemeral texts that are both quotidian (graffiti, mail, crumpled drafts) and, by their very ubiquity, illegible – too numerous, too ordinary, to reward sustained attention.

It is for good reason, then, that the *Poèmes* frequently appear in scholarly histories of new media. *The New Media Reader*, for example, reprints Queneau’s work in a section entitled “Six Selections by the Oulipo,” curated and prefaced by Nick Montfort. No stranger to constraints in his own work – Montfort is the author of *2002: A Palindrome Story*, which reads the same backwards and forwards – he prefaces the selection by observing how Oulipian texts often empower readers through a sense of combinatorial play:

> The potential that lies within such an understanding of interactive experiences is a reconfiguration of the relationship between reader, author, and text. The playful construction within constraints that the Oulipo defined as the role of the author can become an activity extended to readers, who can take part in the interpretation, configuration, and construction of texts. (148)

The *Poèmes*, in particular, carry “the potential to define a new type of computer-mediated textuality, producing custom poems in ways that give the reader an enhanced role in the process of literary creation” (147). Montfort is not alone in reading Queneau’s work as a precursor of digital textuality: his preface echoes the way Espen J. Aarseth, in his landmark study *Cybertext*, repeatedly cites the *Poèmes* as an example of “ergodic literature,” where the reader plays a non-trivial role in the construction of the text – a predecessor, Aarseth argues, of “digital systems for information storage and retrieval” that allow text to be rapidly parsed and recombined (10). In line with this interpretation of potential literature as a practice of creative *reading*, Stephen Ramsay invokes the Oulipo as a model for his own theory of “algorithmic criticism” and its “emphasis on the liberating forces of (computationally enforced) constraint” (xi). He cites Queneau’s *Poèmes* in order to show how forms of procedural reading might augment, rather than terminate, the practices of heightened attention and sustained interpretation that distinguish hermeneutic criticism. The graphs generated by algorithmic reading are not essentially different from the less restrictive filters through which close readers view their objects of study (reading *for* rhyme or reading *for* plot), the result of layers of selective attention, reducing a multifaceted text to a manageable abstraction – an abstraction, however, that still invites and requires critical thought. For all of these scholars, then, the *Poèmes* serve as a paradigmatic example of the way that constraints, like algorithms, are as generative for readers as they are restrictive for writers, looking forward to a digital era when computational processes will inexorably shape and extend the ways we read and write.

In this way, Queneau’s text also anticipates the work of contemporary anglophone poets – many of them inspired by the Oulipo – who turn to constraint-based writing as a response to the superabundance of information in the digital age. In *Nobody’s Business*, for example, a study of twenty-first-century experimental poetry, Brian Reed observes that “writing today is strangely immaterial, able, as electronic bits, completely to transcend the limitations of space and time yet, as viewable text, absurdly weightless, mere dots of transient light that, once gone, leave no trace” (21). Today’s poets, he argues, must contend with “the wholesale displacement of sensuous empirical reality by a more easily managed, dematerialized alternative” – that is, a universal medium in which text and image alike “are reducible to strings of ones and zeros … susceptible to disappearing into an undifferentiated sea of digital bits” (25-6). Why is this sea of bits such a threat to poetry? Because poetry, the argument goes, thrives on the materiality of the signifier: whether verbal or visual, rhetorical or graphic, the texture of the poem as a crafted artifact is what grounds its aesthetic value – as well as the disciplinary practice of close reading for which poetry often serves as an exemplary object. Poetry is unable to keep pace with a world in which texts, reduced to a common binary code, are seamlessly transmitted from medium to medium, platform to platform – without regard for their rhetorical texture or formal complexity.

<!---TODO: Consider adding a footnote on *Not Born Digital*.-->
Reed goes on to argue, however, that poets can and do resist the numbing effects of information overload. They “often confront the reality of the digitally enabled communications revolution by persisting in what they do not simply despite but because of its obsolescence” (2). Rather than seeking to nostalgically return to a pre-digital moment when poetic language is untainted by mass mediation – perhaps there has never been such a moment, at least not since the rise of print culture – many poets choose instead to strategically embrace the obsolescence of their genre, abandoning formal craft altogether and adopting the textureless language of the web as their own. By inscribing digital practices and digital texts within the form of the printed codex, such works of poetry “can gain critical purchase on the push toward mass digitization, the compulsion to reduce all communication to intangible, infinitely portable ones and zeros” (3). Reed gestures towards what we might call a new media poetics of the page (in distinction to born-digital genres like hypertext or electronic poetry) that defamiliarizes the experience of information overload by reframing banal data in and as poetry. Such works constitute what Scott Pound, in a [PMLA]{.smallcaps} article on Kenneth Goldsmith, calls “miniatures of a new cultural ecology in which language-cum-information endlessly flows: abundant, redundant, cheap, and fertile” (328). There is a sort of chiasmus at work here: language is fertile and therefore abundant, multiplying without limit, but this abundance also makes it redundant, cheapened by its very plenitude. Poets call attention to this devaluing of poetic language by imitating its fluid logic, appropriating vast sums of unadulterated prose and reprinting them as books of poetry. Pound describes “a poetry that treats language like so much data or information, chosen for its quantitative rather than its qualitative allure, prized for its mass and availability rather than its originality or aesthetic value” (317-8). By presenting such redundant information as poetry, Pound suggests, these poets seek to rematerialize it, transforming virtual abundance into physical heft. Goldsmith’s *Day*, for example, a transcription of an edition of the Sunday New York Times, impresses readers with its sheer bulk, comprising over eight hundred pages and weighing almost three pounds. In his preface to the anthology *Against Expression* (which he co-edited with Goldsmith), Craig Dworkin argues that such works of “conceptual poetry,” taking after conceptual art, approach language as if it had “a certain opacity and heft” – “something to be digitally clicked and cut, physically moved and reframed, searched and sampled, and poured and pasted.” “The most conceptual poetry,” he contends, “is also some of the least abstract, and the guiding concept behind conceptual poetry may be the idea of language as quantifiable data” (“Echo” xxxvi). From this perspective, conceptualism renews our attention to the codex as a physical substrate, presenting remediated text as something to be looked *at* rather than looked *through*. Even as it claims to exchange its readership for a thinkership (an axiom that the many close readings in my chapters will contest), conceptualism continues to approach poetry as an aesthetic object that can be apprehended and enjoyed through the senses, resisting the way that the digitization of culture threatens to make every medium – and print above all – obsolete.

### A Note on Structure

The dissertation falls into two major sections. I begin with two members of the historic Oulipo, Perec and Calvino, who joined the group in 1967 and 1973 respectively, although their affiliations with constraint-based writing stretch back to the early 1960s. Both of these authors are known primarily for their experimental fiction: Perec’s *La vie mode d’emploi*, published in 1978, won the prestigious *Prix Médicis* the same year and is widely cited as his *chef d'oeuvre* – an encyclopedic novel about a Parisian apartment block, where the lives of its tenants intertwine according to the invisible logic of a knight’s tour across a chessboard; Calvino’s trilology of so-called hypernovels (*Città invisibili* [1972], *Il castello dei destini incrociati* [1979], and *Se una notte d’inverno un viaggiatore* [1973]), all of which William Weaver translated into English almost as quickly as they were published in Italian, established his reputation abroad as a pioneer of postmodern metafiction. I touch upon some of these works in this dissertation: several passages from *La vie mode d’emploi* compliment my reading of Perec’s use of lists in his work – the novel is full of them, especially lists of food and drink – and the frame narrative of *Città invisibili*, also structured around a chessboard, is the focal point of my chapter on Calvino. Although these texts make use of constraints – often subtle enough to escape the attention of their mainstream readers – they also deviate in revealing ways from the protocols that govern much Oulipian writing, and grow out of preoccupations that long predate official membership in the group. As second-generation Oulipians who had already established themselves as gifted writers (and, unlike some of their colleagues, had no formal training in mathematics), their contributions often focused less on theory – concocting new constraints and unearthing old ones – and more on composing original works, which, like all of the examples assembled here, warrant and reward our readerly attention with the adroitness of their execution. This is true even of the more programmatic texts in this assemblage: Perec’s inventory of everything he ate and drank for a year, for example, despite its rigorous premise, turns out to be full of slippages and omissions that reveal, on closer inspection, a surprising resistance to its formal laws. Calvino, for his part, tempers his avowed and oft-criticized penchant for “geometric rationalism” by allowing a degree of multiplicity  – the fine-grained details of an ekphrastic scene, for example – to overwhelm and undermine the Oulipian desire for order (*Six Memos* 70).

In the second half of the dissertation, I turn to the work of three poets – Christian Bök, Caroline Bergvall, and Jen Bervin – who adopt the practice of *écriture sous contrainte* under the rubric (or in the margins) of conceptual poetry. Many of the primary works considered here – *Eunoia*, “Via,” and *Nets* – appear in *Against Expression* alongside formative texts by card-carrying Oulipians (Queneau, Perec, and Duchamp, among others). Conceptualism gives my three readings a common milieu, a unifying polemic that at once rejects the confessional tenor of the mainstream lyric and embraces constraints and other procedural tactics as a way to tarry with (if not wholly to embrace) what Dworkin calls (after Lev Manovich) the “structural logic of the database” (“Poetry” 674). Like all polemics, however, conceptualism is an abstraction, serving to rally a diverse group of poets under a common banner (and against a common enemy). Although these poets share an urgent sense that poetry is under threat in the digital age (and, at the same time, that new media offer unprecedented opportunities for poetic innovation), they remain ambivalent toward the conceptualist project as a whole, especially its tendency to vilify the lyric as a merely confessional or expressivist mode. Read closely, these poems show how constraints can bring affect and embodiment to the fore – often through and against canonical poetic forms (Dante’s *Commedia* and Shakespeare’s Sonnets are the source texts for “Via” and *Nets*, respectively) without reducing affect to an epiphenomenon of personal expression. In these poems, rather, the lyric is a genre that resists any demand for calculable results: the impasses and suspensions of lyric time give readers room to breathe in a technical epoch that seeks to quantify and quantize every dimension of human life. Dismantling the opposition between lyric experience and programmatic constraint, these poems attest that even the most rigid systems and even the harshest restrictions leave room for error, contingency, and play.

I wish to emphasize at the outset that the chronological structure of this dissertation – moving from postwar Europe to today – implies neither a direct path of influence nor a teleological progression. To some degree, of course, Bök, Bergvall, and Bervin have the benefit of reading and reflecting upon the work of their predecessors among the Oulipo. But the way that the legacy of that group, and Perec’s work in particular, circulates among contemporary poets also makes it impossible to disassociate this prior moment from the concerns of the present – when, with the benefit of hindsight, the eclectic preoccupations of potential literature speak with renewed urgency to our own digital moment. I would probably not have chosen to begin with Perec’s inventory of food and drink, for example, had I not first encountered this poem – something of an obscurity even to Perec enthusiasts – in *Against Expression*, framed as an example of conceptual poetry *avant la lettre* and a French analogue to similarly programmatic inventories composed at the same time, across the Atlantic, by conceptual artists like Sol Lewitt and Vito Acconci. The editors of the anthology, to their credit, never claim to legitimate their curatorial decisions through philological or biographical evidence: the texts reproduced in *Against Expression* appear like artworks in a gallery, drawn into a shared narrative by the gravity of their proximity. And without this editorial frame – a polemic, I argue in my first chapter, which overstates the impersonality and artifice of Perec’s deeply idiosyncratic constraint – my argument would have nothing to push back against, no ground for dissensus. So although my readings of Perec and Calvino come first, they also come last (and were written last, at least in part) insofar as they begin with a question posed in the present – how can literature endure in a quantified world? – and delve into the past in order to discover new perspectives and unexpected swerves that throw our contemporary assumptions into disarray. This constellation of Oulipians and “para-Oulipians,” as Jean-Jacques Poucel fondly calls them,[^para-Oulipian] serves less to trace a prehistory of conceptual poetry – one in which the past serves only to legitimate the present, where poetry and technology march forward in lockstep – than to challenge the assumption that digitization is a uniquely contemporary (and therefore intractable) problem. My detour through the historic Oulipo, on the contrary, aims to unearth largely forgotten strategies for resisting the inflexible logic of computation, tracing the ways in which this potential for resistance continues to animate the poetry of the present.

[^oulipo-critics]: See, for example, Christine Wertheim and Matias Viegener’s introduction to the n*oulipoean Analects*, an anthology of reflections on neo-Oulipian poetics, which opposes both the Oulipo and 1960s conceptual art to the body-centric performance art of the 1970s. The editors also echo a familiar opposition between constraint-based practice and the post-romantic lyric that will become, in the hands of conceptual poets, something of a creed:

    > At one level, the interest in voluntarily adopted restrictions is clearly motivated by an attempt to avoid the romantic narcissism of much traditional bourgeois literary production. (Confining oneself to a prescribed contrast naturally turns the writer at least some degree away from self-centered introspection. (1)

    On the complicity between conceptual poetry and techno-capitalism, see Clover.

[^early-oulipo]: On the formative years of the group, see Warren Motte, “Raymond Queneau and the Early Oulipo,” the essays and manifestos collected in *Oulipo: A Primer of Potential Literature*, Jacques Roubaud’s introduction to the *Oulipo Compendium*, and – for minute notes from the first meetings (delightfully replete with interruptions and interjections) – Jacques Bens, *Genese de l’Oulipo: 1960-63*. My use of the word *potential literature* as a standalone phrase also takes after the title of Daniel Levin Becker’s *Many Subtle Channels: In Praise of Potential Literature*.

[^agamben-potential]: Giorgio Agamben develops a similar concept of potential as inoperativity in “Bartleby, or On Contingency.” Sounding the many resonances of the scrivener’s polite refusal (“I would prefer not to”), he argues that *potential* denotes, beyond the capacity to do or to be, a more radical capacity *not* to do or *not* to be. Potentiality rejects “the *principle of the irrevocability of the past* (or of the unrealizability of potentiality in the past)” (262): what is truly potential remains inexhaustible by its passage into actuality. Bartleby embodies this concept of unactualized potential:

    > As a scribe who has stopped writing, Bartleby is the extreme figure of the Nothing from which all creation derives; and at the same time, he constitutes the most implacable vindication of this Nothing as pure, absolute potentiality. The scrivener has become the writing tablet; he is now nothing other than this white sheet. It is not surprising, therefore, that he dwells so obstinately on the abyss of potentiality and does not seem to have the slightest intention of leaving it. (253-4)

    Compare the character of Bartlebooth in Perec’s *La vie mode d’emploi*, who spends his life painting seaside landscapes and making jigsaw puzzles out of them – only, in the end, to have them all chemically erased, returning each canvas (as Agamben might put it) to “nothing other than [a] white sheet.” Bartlebooth is a sort of allegory for the ideal Oulipian, subjecting himself to an exacting constraint but leaving this constraint unrealized, negated. On the origins of his name (a portmanteau of Melville’s Bartleby and Larbaud’s Barnabooth) see Perec, *Entretiens et Conférences* [I]{.smallcaps}, 288.
    
[^para-Oulipian]: Poucel coins this phrase in a special issue of the online journal *Drunken Boat*, prefacing a selection of texts from the Oulipo and its successors across different arts and different media:
     
    > In this special feature of *Drunken Boat*, I have attempted to bear witness to several facts: that the Oulipo has authoritatively demonstrated the viability of thinking and realizing potentiality through the use of literary constraints, that this demonstration resonates with many skilled para-Oulipians who pursue similar strategies, and that the Oulipian excursions into fields of potentiality have encouraged artists and thinkers in other realms to embark on their own conscious experiments in freedom.

[^queneau-duration]: The preface to Chapman’s translation in the *Oulipo Compendium* explains the calculation in more detail:

    > Start with the first line taken in isolation: there are, obviously, 10 alternatives or possibilities for it. When we now add a line, we know that each of the 10 first lines can be followed by any of the 10 second lines: this gives us 10 x 10 = 100 (or 10^2^) possible combinations of two lines. Each of these combinations of two lines can in turn be followed by any of the 10 third lines, a step that will produce 10 x 100 = 1,000 (or 10^3^) possible combinations of *three* lines. In similar fashion, every additional line raises the number of possible combinations by a factor of 10 until, with the 14th line, we attain 10^14^ possible combinations of fourteen lines, a number that can be variously written as 100 billion (UK), 100,000 billion (US), or 100 million million – a very large number however you write it. Queneau calculated that someone reading the book 24 hours a day would need 190,258,751 years to finish it. (14)

[^graphs]: Here I echo the title of Franco Moretti’s *Graphs, Maps, Trees: Abstract Models for Literary History*, one of a series of books in which Moretti applies his method of “distant reading” to the task of analyzing patterns in massive corpora of literary texts. Although his work has become a touchstone for digital humanists who use algorithms to visualize literary forms, Moretti rarely makes use of computers himself: the data for this book (as well as for the more recent *Distant Reading*) were collected by hand (often with the help of beleaguered graduate student researchers). In this sense, Moretti’s work bears comparison with that of conceptual poets who make a spectacle of manually performing otherwise automable tasks – including the processing of archives whose sheer bulk makes them all but unreadable. For a brief comparison between conceptual poetry and distant reading, see Ardam 136.

[^stiegler-automatic]: For a philosophical response to the crisis of automation (which, by some accounts, threatens to render half of the global population unemployed in a matter of decades), see Bernard Stiegler, *Automatic Society*. My argument builds upon Stiegler’s sustained critique of the fact that, today, almost all human activity is encoded “in the form of binary numbers and hence as *calculable* data, forming the base of an automatic society in which *every* dimension of life becomes a functional agent for an industrial economy that thereby becomes *hyper-industrial*” (19-20).

[^post-medium]: For the origins of this term, see Rosalind Krauss, “Two Moments from the Post-Medium Condition” and “Reinventing the Medium.” Reading Walter Benjamin’s famous essay on photography (“Das Kunstwerk im Zeitalter seiner technischen Reproduzierbarkeit”) against the backdrop of conceptual and post-conceptual art, Krauss suggests that, for Benjamin, photography’s erosion of the aura of the image marks not only a specific moment in the history of technical reproduction but, more radically, the general dissolution of differences among the arts and among media that defined modernist aesthetics. What withers with photography, Krauss argues, is not just aura but also

    > the idea of a medium as such, a medium as a set of conventions derived from (but not identical with) the material conditions of a given technical support, conventions out of which to develop a form of expressiveness that can be both projective and mnemonic. And if photography has a role to play at this juncture, which is to say at this moment of postconceptual, “post medium” production, Benjamin may have already signaled to us that it is due to its very passage from mass use to obselesence. (“Reinventing” 296)

    Coined for the first time in quotation marks (as if citing another source – a symptom, perhaps, of the role that iteration and appropriation play in the logic of new media), the phrase *post medium* here also echoes Friedrich Kittler’s theory of media convergence at the beginning of *Gramophone, Film, Typewriter*:

    > Before the end, something is coming to an end. The general digitization of channels and information erases the differences among individual media. Sound and image, voice and text are reduced to surface effects, known to consumers as interface. Sense and the senses turn into eyewash. Their media-produced glamour will survive for an interim as a by-product of strategic programs. Inside the computers themselves everything becomes a number: quantity without image, sound or voice. And once optical fiber networks turn formerly distinct data flows into a standardized series of digitized numbers, any medium can be translated into any other. With numbers, everything goes. Modulation, transformation, synchronization; delay, storage, transposition; scrambling, scanning, mapping – a total media link on a digital base will erase the very concept of medium. Instead of wiring people and technologies, absolute knowledge will run as an endless loop. (1-2)

    For a critique of Kittler and Krauss, see Mark Hansen, *New Philosophy for New Media*, which challenges these theorists for failing to acknowledge the ways in which the body, and especially embodied cognition, “continues to be the active framer of the image, even in a digital regime” (xvii).
    
[^thinkership]: In his preface to the anthology *Against Expression*, Craig Dworkin draws this distinction between *thinkership* and *readership* – which has since become a commonplace in criticism on conceptual poetry – in reference to the paintings of conceptual artist Mel Ramsden, whose series *100% Abstract* “continue[s] to enunciate the move from works seeking an embodied viewership to those eliciting a mental thinkership” (“Echo” xxix).

[^summaries]: There is some irony in the fact that introductions to the art of constraint-based writing often commence by enumerating summaries of exemplary works, given that many of the works in question are themselves structured as lists. A recent issue of *McSweeney’s*, for example, announces the publication of the Oulipo anthology *All That Is Evident Is Suspect* with the following litany:

    > [INSIDE]{.smallcaps}: Sharks as poets and vice versa, the Brisbane pitch drop experiment, novel classifications for real or imaginary libraries, the monumental sadness of difficult loves, the obsolescence of the novel, the symbolic significance of the cup-and-ball game, holiday closures across the Francophone world, what happens at Fahrenheit 452, Warren G. Harding’s dark night of the soul, Marcel Duchamp’s imperviousness to conventional spacetime laws, bilingual palindromes, cartoon eodermdromes, oscillating poems, métro poems, metric poems, literary madness, straw cultivation.

    For a literary example of this sort of breathless catalogue, see Darren Wershler-Henry’s *Tapeworm Foundry*, a poetic list composed entirely of instructions for generating works of art and literature, ordered at random and sutured together by the unpunctuated conjunction “andor.” The text begins mid-sentence (with a citation from *Finnegans Wake*):
    
    > jetsam in the laminar flow andor find the threads in redhats andor litter a keyboard with milletseed so that exotic songbirds might tap out their odes to a nightingale andor transcribe the letters pressed onto the platen when stalactites drip on the homerow keys andor reconstruct the ruins of a bombedout capital i andor reinvent the canonic works of western art as a series of roadsign glyphs andor commission an artist to paint the large ass of marcel duchamp andor use a dotmatrix printer to sound out a poem in which each line is a series of pauses whose length is determined by formatting codes and then record the squeal and lurch of the printhead moving across the paper and then replay the noise and then have it transcribed as chamber music for cello or voice andor compose a text acknowledging that words are fourdimensional objects in spacetime andor write an essay on the collected works of jane austen treating the text as a tour de force lipogram that never once makes use of any characters in the sinhalese alphabet ...

    And so on.
