# Introduction

Imagine a text that can be summed up in a sentence. Imagine a list, for example, that contains everything the author ate and drank for a year, organized by food group and tabulated by quantity, down to the last bottle of Calvados or raspberry sorbet. Imagine a story about sixty-four cities – all of them imaginary (and suspiciously alike) – that together form the grid of an elaborate game of chess. Imagine a book of poetry in which each chapter use only a single English vowel, weaving a perfectly grammatical epic out of words like *parallax*, *belvedere*, *gingivitis*, and *monochord*. Imagine a different sort of list, this time alphabetical, that contains every English-language translation of the first tercet of Dante’s *Commedia*, a list whose digressions and repetitions mirror the pilgrim’s bewilderment at finding himself lost, again, in the middle of a dark wood. Imagine a book that takes Shakespeare’s Sonnets and erases all but a handful of words, forging a new poem out of those that remain, enclosed within the whitespace left by those that do not. Imagine a text, in short, you can grasp purely as a concept, a poem you can deduce from its title, a book you can enjoy without turning a single page. That all of these are actual texts – Georges Perec’s “Tentative d’inventaire des aliments liquides et solides que j’ai ingurgité au cours de l’année mil neuf cent soixante-quatorze,” Italo Calvino’s *Citta invisibili*, Christian Bök’s *Eunoia*, Caroline Bergvall’s *Via*, and Jen Bervin’s *Nets* – hardly diminishes the sense of potential encapsulated by the concepts that shape their composition. One could just as easily imagine a potential text that remains unwritten: the isopangram, for example, is straightforward enough – a sentence that uses each of the twenty-six letters of the alphabet only once – and yet has so far proven impossible to write. Simple to describe, fiendishly difficult to execute: such works of potential literature begin their life as constraints that delineate in advance (without wholly dictating) the form that the finished work can take – and serve, after the fact, as its definitive gloss. To call such forms of literature *potential* is to acknowledge that a constraint, once formulated, already encompasses all the ways it could possibly be exemplified, just as the sonnet form already contains every possible sonnet. Potential literature *stricto sensu* is not literature at all, but the possibility of literature – and this possibility (even or especially when it is left unrealized) carries an aesthetic value that no extant text can exhaust.

Throughout this dissertation, I use the term potential literature (uncapitalized, unabbreviated) to encompass a wide variety of constraint-based texts written in different countries, different languages (French, Italian, and English), and different decades – from the early 1960s to today. Although I approach this genre as an international phenomenon (with an eye to its rich afterlife among contemporary anglophone poets), it is worth briefly recalling the origins of potential literature in postwar France, the name of an eclectic group (not quite a coterie, much less a movement) founded by François le Lionnais and Raymond Queneau at Cerisy-la-Salle in 1960. Other prototypes preceded it: the Séminaire de Littérature Expérimentale – a subcommittee of the Collège de Pataphysique – swiftly took leave of this umbrella organization and dropped the name *Séminaire* (with its scholastic overtones, deemed to be too sterile, too *structuralist*) by its second meeting. (Queneau was the official scribe of Alexandre Kojève’s seminars on Hegel – in the company of Georges Batailles, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Jacques Lacan – although he later sought to distance himself from the dominant strands of postwar French theory. In the Second Manifesto, François le Lionnais urges the reader not to confuse the group’s penchant for literary structures with structuralism proper – “a term that many of us consider with circumspection” [29].) And so the Ouvroir de Littérature Potentielle was born. Oulipo for short, giving each syllable of its triadic structure an equal semantic weight. *Ouvroir*: not just a workshop, but a workroom – originally denoting a convent where nuns assemble to work, a sewing circle, a place of handicraft. (Perec contrasts the word with *oeuvre*, which implies canonicity and consecration. The work of the *ouvroir* is more collective than individual, more artisanal than artistic, more laborious than inspired [ctd. in Motte 9-10]). *Literature*: although the Oulipo has spawned numerous analogues in other media and other genres – the Oucuipo, for example, abbreviates the Workshop of Potential Cuisine – the group began as an exploration of the potentiality specific to literary and linguistic structures – from minute permutations of the alphabetic code (anagrams, lipograms, palindromes) to the epic scale of encyclopedic novels whose plots derive from the rules of chess. (Two such novels – Calvino’s *Invisible Cities* and Perec’s *Life a User’s Manual* – make an appearance in this dissertation.) The fact that literary texts are made primarily of letters (in the European tradition, at least) – and therefore constitute a discrete sequence that can be subdivided, inverted, and freely rearranged – inspires the early efforts of the Oulipo to formalize natural language and impose constraints that make literary texts precisely quantifiable: Perec’s 1969 novel *La Disparition*, for example, entirely omits words that contain the letter *e* – a fact that either a simple algorithm or an assiduous human could verify beyond doubt. (That early readers overlooked this obvious omission testifies to the masterful subtlety with which Perec carried out his constraint.) At the same time, the existing codification of literary (and especially poetic) genres, many of them deemed obsolete – the villanelle, the rondeau, the sonnet, among others – legitimized the Oulipian project of reviving old forms and devising new ones.

This is the essential vocation of the group: to discover and to invent (*inventio*: to find again) constraints that can be used to craft literary texts – texts that would otherwise be unthinkable. And here we arrive at the third term – one that echoes throughout the Oulipo archive and one that proves the most difficult to pin down, a sort of *point de capiton* that sutures the Oulipo together and yet itself remains elusive. The [OED]{.smallcaps} defines *potential* as “[p]ossible as opposed to actual; having or showing the capacity to develop into something in the future; latent; prospective.” Derived from the Latin *potentia* – force, power, ability (although also, in ecclesiastical Latin, a crutch, a prosthesis), *potential* in this sense describes what something *can* do – whatever is possible, capacious, prospective – and directs itself toward a future when this latent possibility will finally be actualized. In this sense, potential is powerful, even violent – a taut bow, an unsprung trap – that befits its imperial etymon, “[p]ossessing potency or power; potent, powerful, mighty, strong; commanding.” But potential is also the absence of actuality. What is *possible* is not yet actual and what is latent is not yet manifest. Without this latency, potential is impotent: the sprung trap is no longer a threat. Potential is the abyss between capacity and act, between what something *can* do or be and the doing or being itself. Potential is therefore also the capacity *not* to do or *not* to be, to defer action indefinitely, remaining forever unactualized. To be potential is to be – at least for the time being – inactive, reticent, dormant.

In the entry on *potential* in the *Oulipo Compendium*, Harry Matthews quotes the above definition from the [OED]{.smallcaps}, adding his own gloss:

> The last word of *Ouvroir de littérature potentielle* defines the specificity of the Oulipo. From its beginnings the group has insisted on the distinction between “created creations” (*créations créés*) and “creations that create” (*créations créantes*), to the benefit of the latter: it has been concerned not with literary works but with procedures and structures capable of producing them. When the first sonnet was written almost a thousand years ago, what counted most was not the poem itself but a new potentiality of future poems. Such potentialities are what the Oulipo invents or discovers. (“potential”)

Like many of his fellow Oulipians, Matthews emphasizes the generative potential of constraints, their capacity to engender new poems in a yet undefined future. Whether focused on invention or discovery – what Le Lionnais calls the “synthetic” and the “analytic” modes of the Oulipo, proposing new constraints and reviving old ones – the Oulipo is essentially productive and creative, furnishing writers with tools for constructing truly original works of literature (a rarity, the Oulipians often lament, in a literary world that seems to place little value on formal competence). At the core of this definition is the distinction between *créations créantes* and *créations créés*, between potential literature (or constraints that *could* be used to write literature) and literature proper (including literary texts written under constraint). According to its founders, the Oulipo *stricto sensu* concerns only the former, relegating the latter to what Warren Motte calls, only half in jest, the “limbo” of the “applied Oulipo.” (Although this limbo is also home to the group’s most celebrated works: the prize-winning novels of Perec and Calvino avowedly belong to the realm of applied constraint, not to the realm of pure potential. Had the Oulipo insisted too rigidly upon this distinction, refusing to count such works as its own, it may well have perished in obscurity.) Queneau echoes this distinction in his definition of potential:

> The word ‘potential’ concerns the very nature of literature, that is, fundamentally it’s less a question of literature strictly speaking than of supplying forms for the good use one can make of literature. We call potential literature the search for new forms and structures which may be used by writers in any way they see fit. (ctd. in Arnaud xiii)

Even as he distinguishes potential literature from “literature strictly speaking,” Queneau suggests that its aim consists of “supplying forms,” like moulds to be filled, for writers to use “in any way they see fit.” Constraints serve “the good use one can make of literature,” and potential – for all of its associations with absence and deferral – exists to be actualized. At the same time, however, Queneau gestures towards the obverse sense of the word by implying that potential literature is not properly literature at all, only something that could – in the right circumstances, in the right hands – become literature. Matthews, for his part, cedes that this becoming might never take place, that a work of potential literature might remain unactualized, unwritten: he cites the isopangram, which, as I have already noted, is so improbable that no example yet exists. Other constraints have a vanishingly short half-life: Le Lionnais’ constraint for a one-letter poem can be repeated only twenty-six times. Despite their emphasis on literary creation, then, these definitions suggest that potential literature keeps something in reserve, that its potential is never completely (or irreversibly) actualized. It is for this reason, as David Levin Becker argues, that “no static definition of potential literature exists: it remains an ineffable ideal toward which members are free to work as they see fit, each beholden to his or her own fascinations and bugbears and biases.”

Among the many divergent attempts to define and delimit the Oulipo, however, there is one exemplary text that appears again and again – even though its own literary potential remains radically unrealized. Published by Éditions Gallimard in 1961, Queneau’s *Cent mille milliards de poèmes* is widely credited as the inaugural Oulipian text, one that, like its many successors, at first seems disarmingly simple: a sequence of ten sonnets, composed in a flippant yet charming sort of doggrel. Here is the first quatrain of the first sonnet (with an English translation by Stanley Chapman):

> | Le roi de la pampa retourne sa chemise
> | Pour la mettre à sécher aux cornes des taureaux
> | Le cornedbeef en boîte empeste la remise
> | Et fermentent de même et les cuirs et les peaux
<!---TODO: Add citation.-->

> | Don Pedro from his shirt has washed the fleas
> | The bull’s horns ought to dry it like a bone
> | Old corned-beef’s rusty armor spreads disease
> | That suede ferments is not at all well known (15)

Between each of these lines is a dotted border, marked with a scissors glyph that invites the reader to cut the book apart.  With the loose lines still attached to the spine, the *Poèmes* become a sort of flip book that allows readers to construct their own sonnets, choosing one line at a time from among ten possible variants. (Queneau credits the idea to children’s books that allow their readers to assemble monsters by flipping segmented pages – selecting a head, a torso, and a pair of legs from the bodies of different imaginary creatures.) No matter how readers recombine the composite lines, the rules of the Petrarchan sonnet – meter, rhyme scheme, even, to some degree, the delicate balance between octet and sestet –remain intact (as do the rules of French grammar). This structure makes the *Poèmes* doubly potential: first, in the sense that the concept precedes and constrains the writing itself (a book of ten sonnets whose lines can all be interchanged); and second, that the book is, in the words of Calvino, a “sonnet machine,” capable of generating a vast quantity of *possible* sonnets – 10^14^ sonnets, to be exact, one hundred trillion (or, as in the French title, one hundred thousand million). Queneau calculates that even the most dedicated bookworm – at the rate of one sonnet a minute, eight hours a day, two hundred days a year – would require over a million centuries to read them all. Le Lionnais expands upon this sense of enormity in his postface to the work:

> Thanks to [its] technical superiority, the work you are holding in your hands represents, itself alone, a quantity of text far greater than everything man has written since the invention of writing, including popular novels, business letters, diplomatic correspondence, private mail, rough drafts thrown into the wastebasket, and graffiti.

With a nod to Borges’ Library of Babel (structured by an analogous principle, containing every possible combination of the letters of the alphabet), Le Lionnais discerns in the *Poèmes* a form of information overload, a sublime excess of textual data that – like other mass media (and even more voluminous) – threatens to overwhelm our readerly senses. That this vast archive fits comfortably into the reader’s hands – a “technical superiority,” as Le Lionnais puts it – anticipates our own digital moment when just about “everything man has written since the invention of writing” can indeed be squeezed onto a pocket-sized device. Like digital text (which is typically stored as a sequence of 8-bit Unicode characters, a binary code that can be endlessly permuted and recombined), the *Poèmes* achieves its peculiar density by atomizing the sonnet into its component lines, a set of discrete units whose possible combinations exceed by many orders of magnitude the space they occupy in their physical medium. Like an anagram (or Borges’ Library, for that matter), the potentiality of the *Poèmes* emerges in part from this combinatoric structure, whose minimal units – letters for Borges, lines for Queneau –  already implicitly contain all their possible orderings. At the same time, however, this potential is fated to remain unrealized: no reader (no human reader, at least) could ever read the work in its entirety. Queneau anticipates a post-human future when the efficiency of machine readers (already nascent in the early 1960s in the form of automated punchcards) threaten to render human reading wholly obsolete – a future where text is produced and consumed on a radically inhuman scale. Le Lionnais suggests that this future is already here: the *Poèmes* enter into an assemblage of ephemeral texts that are both quotidian (graffiti, mail, crumpled drafts) and, by their very ubiquity, illegible – too numerous, too ordinary, to reward sustained attention.

It is for good reason, then, that the *Poèmes* frequently appear in scholarly histories of new media. *The New Media Reader*, for example, reprints Queneau’s work in a section entitled “Six Selections By the Oulipo,” curated and prefaced by Nick Montfort. No stranger to constraints in his own work – Montfort is the author of *2002: A Palindrome Story*, which reads the same backwards and forwards – he prefaces the selection by observing how Oulipian texts often empower readers through a sense of combinatorial play:

> The potential that lies within such an understanding of interactive experiences is a reconfiguration of the relationship between reader, author, and text. The playful construction within constraints that the Oulipo defined as the role of the author can become an activity extended to readers, who can take part in the interpretation, configuration, and construction of texts. (148)

The *Poèmes*, in particular, carry “the potential to define a new type of computer-mediated textuality, producing custom poems in ways that give the reader an enhanced role in the process of literary creation” (147). Montfort is not alone in reading Queneau’s work as a precursor of digital textuality: his preface echoes the way Espen J. Aarseth, in his landmark study *Cybertext*, repeatedly cites the *Poèmes* as an example of “ergodic literature,” where the reader plays a non-trivial in the construction of the text – a predecessor, Aarseth argues, of “digital systems for information storage and retrieval” that allow text to be rapidly parsed and recombined (10). In line with this reading of potential literature as a practice of creative *reading*, Stephen Ramsay invokes the Oulipo as a model for his own theory of “algorithmic criticism” and its “emphasis on the liberating forces of (computationally enforced) constraint” (xi). Connecting this line of inquiry to distant reading and the digital humanities, Ramsay cites Queneau’s *Poèmes* in order to show how forms of procedural reading might augment, rather than terminate, the practices of heightened attention and sustained interpretation that distinguish hermeneutic criticism. The graphs, maps, and trees generated by algorithmic reading are not essentially different from the less restrictive filters through which close readers view their objects of study (reading *for* rhyme or reading *for* plot), the result of layers of selective attention, reducing a multifaceted text to a manageable abstraction, an abstraction, however, that still invites and requires critical thought. For all of these scholars, then, Queneau’s *Poèmes* serves as a paradigmatic example of the way that constraints, like algorithms, are as generative for readers as they are restrictive for writers, looking forward to a digital era when computational processes will inexorably shape and extend the ways we read and write.

Queneau’s *Poèmes* anticipate the ways in which contemporary anglophone poets – many of them inspired by the Oulipo – respond to the superabundance of information in the digital age. In *Nobody’s Business*, for example, a study of twenty-first-century experimental poetry, Brian Reed observes that “writing today is strangely immaterial, able, as electronic bits, completely to transcend the limitations of space and time yet, as viewable text, absurdly weightless, mere dots of transient light that, once gone, leave no trace” (21). Today’s poets, he argues, must contend with “the wholesale displacement of sensuous empirical reality by a more easily managed, dematerialized alternative” – that is, a universal medium in which text and image alike “are reducible to strings of ones and zeros … susceptible to disappearing into an undifferentiated sea of digital bits” (25-6). Why is this sea of bits such a threat to poetry? Because poetry, the argument goes, thrives on the materiality of the signifier: whether verbal or visual, rhetorical or graphic, the texture of the poem as a crafted artifact is what grounds its aesthetic value – as well as the disciplinary practices of close reading and sustained interpretation for which poetry often serves as an exemplary object. Poetry is unable to keep pace with a world in which texts, reduced to a common binary code, are seamlessly transmitted from medium to medium, platform to platform – without regard for their rhetorical texture or formal complexity.

Reed goes on to argue, however, that poets can and do resist the numbing effects of information overload. They “often confront the reality of the digitally enabled communications revolution by persisting in what they do not simply despite but because of its obsolescence” (2). Rather than seeking to nostalgically return to a pre-digital moment when poetic language is untainted by mass mediation – perhaps there was no such moment, at least not since the rise of print culture – many poets choose instead to strategically embrace the obsolescence of their genre, abandoning formal craft altogether and adopting the textureless language of the web as their own. By inscribing digital practices and digital texts within the form of the printed codex, such works of poetry “can gain critical purchase on the push toward mass digitization, the compulsion to reduce all communication to intangible, infinitely portable ones and zeros” (3). Reed gestures towards what we might call a new media poetics of the page (in distinction to born-digital genres like hypertext or electronic poetry) – one that defamiliarizes the experience of information overload by reframing that experience in and as poetry – a genre that appears to be its polar opposite. Such works constitute what Scott Pound, in an [PMLA]{.smallcaps} article on Kenneth Goldsmith, calls “miniatures of a new cultural ecology in which language-cum-information endlessly flows: abundant, redundant, cheap, and fertile” (328). There is a sort of chiasmus at work here: language is fertile and therefore abundant, multiplying without limit, but this abundance also makes it redundant, cheapened by its very plenitude. Poets call attention to this devaluing of poetic language by imitating its fluid logic, appropriating vast sums of unadulterated prose and reprinting them as books of poetry. Pound describes “a poetry that treats language like so much data or information, chosen for its quantitative rather than its qualitative allure, prized for its mass and availability rather than its originality or aesthetic value” (317-8). Part of the strategy is to rematerialize such redundant information, transforming virtual abundance into physical heft. Goldsmith’s *Day*, for example, a transcription of an edition of the Sunday New York Times, impresses readers with its sheer bulk, comprising over eight hundred pages and weighing almost three pounds. In his preface to the anthology *Against Expression*, Craig Dworkin argues that such works of “conceptual poetry,” taking after conceptual art, approach language as if had “a certain opacity and heft” – “something to be digitally clicked and cut, physically moved and reframed, searched and sampled, and poured and pasted.” “The most conceptual poetry,” he contends, “is also some of the least abstract, and the guiding concept behind conceptual poetry may be the idea of language as quantifiable data” (“Echo” xxxvi). From this perspective, conceptualism renews our attention to the codex as a physical substrate, presenting remediated text as something to be looked *at* rather than looked *through*. Even as it obviates the practice of close reading (conceived as sustained attention to the rhetorical and verbal texture of a work), conceptualism still approaches poetry as an aesthetic object that can be apprehended and enjoyed through the senses, resisting the way that the digitization of culture threatens to make every medium – and print above all – obsolete.

The dissertation falls into two major sections, ordered chronologically. I begin with two members of the historic Oulipo – Georges Perec and Italo Calvino – who joined the group in 1967 and 1973 respectively, although their affiliations with constraint-based writing stretch back to the early 1960s. Both Perec and Calvino are known primarily for their experimental fiction: Perec’s *La vie mode d’emploi*, published in 1978, won the prestigious *Prix Médicis* the same year and is widely cited as his *chef d'oeuvre* – an encyclopedic novel about a Parisian apartment block whose lives intertwine according to the invisible logic of an elaborate game of chess; Calvino’s trilology of so-called hypernovels (*Citta invisibili* [1972], * Il castello dei destini incrociati* [1979], and * Se una notte d’inverno un viaggiatore* [1973]), all of which William Weaver translated into English almost as quickly as they were published in Italian, established his reputation abroad as a pioneer of postmodern metafiction. I touch upon some of these works in this dissertation: several passages from *La vie mode d’emploi* compliment my reading of Perec’s use of lists in his work – the novel is full of them, especially of food and drink – and the frame narrative of *Invisible Cities*, also structured around a chessboard, is the focal point of my chapter on Calvino. Although these texts make use of constraints – often subtle enough to escape the attention of their mainstream readers – they are not strictly Oulipian. They do not adopt global constraints – Perec’s most famous constraint-based novel, *La disparition*, is a lipogram that entirely omits the letter *e* <!---TODO: you’ve already said this-->– and they grow out of preoccupations that long predate official membership in the group. I do not spend many pages tracing the web of philological connections between Perec, Calvino, and their fellow Oulipians – a task that others have already undertaken with great aplomb. <!---For a starting place, consider Motte, “Calvino and the Oulipo.” And list a bunch of works on Perec.-->As second-generation members of the group who had already established themselves as gifted writers (and, unlike some of their colleagues, had no formal training in mathematics), their contributions often focused less on theory – concocting new constraints and unearthing old ones – and more on composing original works, or what purists like François le Lionnais and Jacques Roubaud call, only half in jest, “the limbo of the applied Oulipo.” <!---TODO: Repetition.-->Limbo is where this dissertation dwells: all of the works assembled here, although many have their origins in constraints, warrant and reward our readerly attention with the adroitness of their execution. This is true even of the more programmatic texts in this assemblage: Perec’s inventory of everything he ate and drank for a year, for example, despite its rigorous premise, turns out to full of slippages and omissions that reveal, on closer inspection, a surprising resistance to its formal laws. Calvino, for his part, tempers his avowed and oft-criticized penchant for “geometric rationalism” by allowing a degree of multiplicity – the fine-grained details of an ekphrastic scene, for example – to overwhelm and undermine the Oulipian desire for order.

To some degree, of course, the three contemporary poets have the benefit of reading and reflecting upon the work of their predecessors among the Oulipo. But the way that the legacy of that group, and Perec’s work in particular, circulates among contemporary poets <!---TODO: repetition-->also makes it impossible to disassociate this prior moment from the concerns of the present, discovering there, with the benefit of hindsight, forms and concepts that speak with renewed urgency to our own digital moment. I likely would not have chosen to begin with Perec’s inventory of food and drink, for example, had I not first encountered this poem – something of an obscurity even to Perec enthusiasts – in the influential anthology *Against Expression*, framed as an example of conceptual poetry *avant la lettre* and a French analogue to similarly programmatic inventories composed at the same time, across the Atlantic, by conceptual artists like Sol Lewitt and Vito Acconci. The editors of the anthology, to their credit, never claim to legitimate their curatorial decisions through philological or biographical evidence: the texts reproduced in *Against Expression* appear like artworks in a gallery, drawn into a shared narrative by the gravity of their proximity. And without this editorial frame – a polemic, I argue in my first chapter, which overstates the impersonality and artifice of Perec’s deeply idiosyncratic constraint – my reading would have nothing to push back against, no ground for dissensus. So although my readings of Perec and Calvino come first, they also come last (and were written last, at least in part) insofar as they begin with a question posed in the present – how can literature endure in a quantified world? – and delve into the past in order to discover new perspectives and unexpected swerves that throw our contemporary assumptions into disarray. This constellation of Oulipians and “para-Oulipians,” as Jean-Jacques Poucel fondly calls them, serves less to trace a prehistory of conceptual poetry – one in which the past serves only to legitimate the present, where poetry and technology march forward in lockstep – than to challenge the assumption that digitization is a uniquely contemporary (and therefore intractable) problem. My detour through the historic Oulipo, on the contrary, aims to unearth largely forgotten strategies for resisting the inflexible logic of computation, tracing the way this potential for resistance continues to animate the poetry of the present.
