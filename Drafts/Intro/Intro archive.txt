Throughout this dissertation, I use the term potential literature (uncapitalized, unabbreviated) to encompass a wide variety of constraint-based texts written in different countries, different languages (French, Italian, and English), and different decades – from the early 1970s to today. But the term also has a more specific point of origin, one that casts its long shadow over all the works I discuss: the Parisian restaurant 



The Ouvroir de Literature 

the name of an eclectic group (not quite a coterie, much less a movement) founded by François le Lionnais and Raymond Queneau at Cerisy-la-Salle in 1960.

Although Perec and Calvino rarely *refer* to computers in their literary works – the latter’s essays and lectures are more explicit on this front, dreaming of a world reduced to “weightless bits” – they explore forms and figures (often borrowed from mathematics) that serve to quantify phenomena and render the sensible world precisely calculable: Perec’s enumeration of his annual diet, for example, framed as a sort of Rabelaisian catalogue, insists upon tabulating the exact quantity of each foodstuff he ingests – a practice that anticipates the modern use of biosensors (on the FitBit or Apple Watch, for example) to log a user’s every heartbeat or footfall – even as the playfulness of his account undermines its veracity at every turn.
