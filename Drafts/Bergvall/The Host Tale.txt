The fruyt of every tale is for to seye (706)
They ete, and drynke, and daunce, and synge, and pleye. (707)
  They soupen and they speke, hem to solace, (4146)
  And drynken evere strong ale atte beste. (4147)
“Now lat us sitte and drynke, and make us merie, (88)
And lat us dyne as soone as that ye may; (205)
What! lat us heere a messe, and go we dyne. (223)
The service doon, they soupen al by day. (297)
And to the dyner faste they hem spedde, (253)
[What! lat us heere a messe] and go we dyne. (223)
[To vouche sauf som day] with hym to dyne. (1083)
To come to dyner[], as he hym bisoughte;] (1094)
And thus I lete hem ete and drynke and pleye, (73)
But thus I lete in lust and jolitee (344)
I lete hem, til men to the soper dresse. (290)
They ete and drynke; and whan this hadde and ende, (295)
Of mete and drynke, [and in hir foul delit.] (1875)
And eten also and drynken over hir myght, (468)
To eten of the smale peres grene. (2333)

COMMENTS
========

Non-standard spelling.
Multilingualism.
See Bergvall’s note on Chaucer.
(And in this way related to the Dante translation.)
Early modern English: reveals the self-difference
within English. (Just as “Via” reveals the self-difference
within the Italian.)
Makes GREP difficult in some cases.
(Parsing depends on consistent spelling.)
Like Via, achronological.
Bergvall’s fascination  with the refrain.
Both with its music and with its iterative structure.
(Repetition and difference.)
The referent of "hem" (them?) becomes obscured:
all the referents become one mass, one throng.
A bit like the I in Fitterman’s No. Wait. Yep.
Leaving the spelling unmodernized.
(Resembles Bergvall’s other work with non-standard spelling,
phonetic spelling.)
It lets her be more polysemic. Make (interlingual) puns.
(Like some of the other Chaucer tales: eke eek hem home)
etc. (Again, there, refrain, and difference, within
and among languages.)
Compare to the tradition of *writing through*.
  Cage’s mesostics, Jackson MacLow, etc.
  (I wish I still had that Dworkin book.)
The opening double quote (without a matching close quote).

Elision/omission? Why? Shorter lines?
(Like the refrain of a rondel.)
Also calls attention to a larger omission,
the space *between* lines. All the other lines
that are missing.
Frequent references to *also* and *and* (anaphora, or whatever:
And then went down to the ship. Beginning with and. The temporality
of epic. Continuance.)
But also *end* (18. when this had an end) when it doesn’t end.
  Foreshadowing: and give my tale an end?


This one is more like the other works in the dissertation
than some of Bergvall’s other Chaucer tales, on account
of the fact that she does not modify the text in any any
other than reframing it (and selecting and rearranging) lines.
Although it’s agglutinative, aggregative, it also omits
and redacts most of Chaucer (as we look forward to Chapter 5,
Bervin’s palimpsest of Shakespeare’s Sonnets) and does not *add*
anything. There are no words here that are not in the original.

### Hospitality
(Except the title: The Host Tale. Mine this for puns.)
(There is a pun: the hostel, the place where they all stay,
the inn. Or who’s tale? Or the hustle.
A stuttering of the *st*. A disfluency.)
(Not the Host’s Tale. The tale that hosts the others
and begins the collection. Sounding the many variants of host
and hospitality: as the one who welcomes guests, and an army:
from the same Greek root ...) A host is also a threat.
(See Derrida on this point? Bonnie Honig? Or ... who writes
about hospitality. That person who ran the ACLA seminar ...)
(Compare Zolf, Neighbor Procedure. Derrida, Of Hospitality.)
(Another question Bergvall explores in her work: how languages
mark the borders between people, exclude, draw a circle around
a group. The most extreme case of this is the shibboleth ...
cf. Bergvall’s work on the Parsley Massacre. Say Parsley.)
(In all of these texts, The Host Tale and Via, taking
a consecrated work that defines, or has been co-opted into,
the origin of a national literature, Chaucer the father
of the English language, Dante the origin of the modern canon, etc.
and then revealing its *internal* difference challenges
the way national languages strive to delineate themselves
from the threat of the outside, the foreigner, etc.)
(And hence the host: the character in Chaucer who welcomes
the pilgrims and provides the frame for all of the subsequent tales,
a common space ... for all those who have traveled, for all these
disparate narratives to cohere ... But is also a threat somehow?
Why? Flyting? With thy fundament depeint? No, I don’t think so.)

And where does digital logic fit into all this? 1) binary,
on/off, inside/outside, one of us or one of them ... the logic
of absolute linguistic difference is a binary logic (something
is either English or its not; a person is either a native (speaker)
or a foreigner, and this foreignness is marked by a difference,
a detectable accent, in how they speak. Parsley. Shibboleth.)

The figure of the Host + festivities + the commons + heteroglossia
(carnival, back to Rabelais with Perec) + Middle English, creole,
polyglot, etc. This is why Bergvall turns to Chaucer.

food: also a marker of difference (national cuisines, etc.)
but also of convergence (all the different food words in Perec’s inventory)
from many different languages ...
That Parsley is also a food is not insigificant.
(That one’s tongue could give one away – how you pronounce a word,
but also what you eat, how you taste (you are what you eat) – could
exclude some and bind others together)
Sound the different valences of tongue: language, taste, etc.

Then it’s also a food *list*, like Rabelais, like Perec.
Where the obscenity (as Barthes calls it) of gastronomy,
of enjoying food for its own sake, dovetails with the excess
of the list as a form that cannot end. (Why Bergvall keeps
referring to ending – and “and whan this hadde and ende” –
a phrase that cuts both ways: suggesting an end but, in
a subordinate clause following *and*, suggesting that
something else is about to continue ... end is itself an and,
not an end to a string of ands. Bergvall’s version of
Perec’s etc. in the middle of his list. So when we finally
get to “and give my tale an end,” we’ve already been prompted
with other *ends* that did not end, suggesting that this too
is a decoy, the promise of an end which is actually
a continuation (and the beginning of the book, a preface).
The poem refrains from delimiting itself from the outside,
from all the other things it could name (a parallel, perhaps,
to the way it refrains from dividing one language from another,
from clearly delineating the linguisic and national contours
of English, here at its primary scene, in the work of
the so-called father of the English language) ...

Actually the phrase is “Here is ended the Host Tale”
(The only line *not* directly from Chaucer.)
(Compare the ending of the others:
Here endeth the Summer Tale.
Here endeth the Franker Tale.
Here endeth the Fried Tale. [51]
And the poem “Doll” from Goan Atom:
This is the & of the world [90])
An earlier work (cite the PennSound recording)
has: “I turn ... and give my tale an end.”
(Cited from memory. Double check this.)

Also compare the Not Tale. A list of negations.
From Arcite’s funeral in the Knight’s tale.

Perhaps a footnote somewhere
on medieval poetics and avant-garde poetry
by women. Stacy Dorris’ *Paramour*,
for example. Rewriting the courtly love
tradition. (Of course Bervin belongs here
too.)

and the body, sexuality, jouissance ?

### A note on the text

> The language party of the “Shorter Chaucer Tales”
was initially prompted and invited by Charles Bernstein
and David Wallace to premiere at the New Chaucer Society’s
annual conference (New York, 28 July, 2006). The first
four pieces of the series, published here, were
subsequently launched as four audiotexts and hosted
on PennSound in October 2006, by Charles Bernstein,
Al Filreis and Michael Hennessey. Thanks to all involved
for their dedication, and especially to Charles Bernstein
for prompting this crucial development in my work. (161)

> “The Host Tale” lists food and drink references
in *The Canterbury Tales*. It first appeared
in its current Middle English form in
the Norwegian literary journal *Vagant* (Oslo,
Spring 2007). Editors Audun Lindholm and Susanne
Christensen let it pass for contemporary Norwegian
preceded by a short preface. (161)
