Despite its hand-sewn binding and letterpress ink, *Nets*, published in 2004, registers a trace of its digital milieu with a title that echoes *network* and *internet* even as it encodes the half-erased word *sonnets*.[^Dworkin-nets] Reprinted in the anthology *Against Expression* and often cited as an exemplary instance of conceptual poetry (a reading, as I have shown, that Bervin pushes back against), the book shares with other procedural works composed at the turn of the millennium an urgent if largely implicit attempt to respond to the rise of digital networks and the radically new forms of writing they make possible. *Nets* engages with the digital less through the conceptualist practice of sampling and remixing existing text – the signature gesture of the poem as readymade – than by showing how erasure, both as a poetic method and as one of the prevailing themes of the Sonnets, embodies the tension at the heart of artificial memory. If, as media theorists like Chun and Hu argue, digital memory depends upon a melancholic compulsion to reiterate loss, a tireless struggle to make the ephemeral endure, *Nets* shows how a similar logic animates the commemorative economy of the Sonnets, which aim to stave off oblivion by constantly rehearsing its inevitability.
