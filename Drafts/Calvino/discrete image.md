Stiegler argues that the digitization of the image (or “discretization,” to use his term: the encoding of images as discrete arrays of numeric values) stages an analogous crisis to the one inflicted on speech by the invention of alphabetic writing, revealing the fact that the continuous analog image is always already discrete. The discretized image destroys the “continguity of luminances” supposed to inhere in the analog image: the belief that light reflected off the photographic subject actually touches a strip of film, and that we are touched in turn by analogous lightwaves reflecting off the surface of the printed image. Every time Nadar’s famous photograph of Baudelaire is printed, for example, “this whole ‘umbilical cord’ constituted by the photons that come to imprint and *physically* touch, from out of the nineteenth century, the *photosensitive* silver halides” [-@stiegler02 152]. Analog media are indexical: they bear the imprint of physical waveforms (either lightwaves hitting unexposed film or soundwaves moving the diaphragm of a microphone) that analogically resemble the sounds and shapes that produced them. This is why photographs and phonographs are called analog in the first place: they store information in a form that is strictly analogous to its source. As Kittler observes:

> They are not only supposed to resemble the object, but rather guarantee this resemblance by being, as it were, a product of the object in question, that is, by being mechanically produced by it – just as the illuminated objects of reality imprint their image on the photo­graphic layer … a reproduction authenticated by the object itself. [-@kittler99 p. 11-12]

This continuity is destroyed by digital media: a bitmap image, for example, stores its data as an array of floating-point decimal values, each pixel represented by a triplet of such values (one each for red, green, and blue). A bitmap is discrete in at least three senses: the continuous plane of the image is divided into equally sized cells, the average color of each cell is sampled (since the cell represents a minute region of light rather than a single point), and each color component of the sampled value is encoded as a floating-point number with a finite bit depth (an 8-bit number, for example, could represent one of 2^8^ or 256 discrete possible values). An image digitized in this way no longer *resembles* the scene it encodes: its relation to the physical lightwaves it records is purely one of statistical measurement. The digital image comprises a series of instructions for reconstructing an image – rather than an analogue of the original source. Because the digital image takes the form of a discrete code rather than a continuous texture, it can be exactly reproduced in any format capable of representing binary data: an image copied across physically diverse media (a solid-state drive, an optical disc, a wifi signal) remains structurally identical. Digital copying does away with the noise inherent in mechanical reproduction: although physical media can be corrupted, the data they store is itself an abstraction completely separate from its medium and can be perfectly reconstructed (as long as another copy exists). In this way, the digital sacrifices the continuity of analogy (where an image is coincident with its material substrate) for the iterability of code. The image becomes a form of writing, a form whose identity – to a degree unprecedented in alphabetic writing – can be rigorously enforced.
