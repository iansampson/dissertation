# exactitude

In the Harvard lectures, Calvino cites the chessboard passage in *Invisible Cities* as an example of a fundamental tension between two forms of “exactitude”:

> As soon as I wrote that page, it became clear to me that my pursuit of exactitude was forking in two directions: on the one hand, the reduction of incidental events to abstract schemes that could be used to perform operations and demonstrate theorems; on the other, the effort of words to convey as precisely as possible the perceptible aspect of things.
> 
> Indeed my writing has always found itself facing two divergent roads that correspond to two kinds of knowledge: one that moves through mental spaces of disembodied rationality, in which lines can be drawn that connect points, projections, abstract shapes, vectors of force; another that moves in a space crowded with objects and seeks to create a verbal equivalent of that space by filling pages with words, in a meticulous effort to match the written to the not-written, to the sum of the sayable and the not-sayable.

Like the novel as a whole, the chessboard passage oscillates between these two extremes: Kublai seeks to reduce the administration of his empire to a game governed by formal logic (an analogy fortified by an army of double-entendres: both games and states have rules, laws, codes, and operations); Polo, on the other hand,  sees the chessboard as an occasion for an ekphrasis, one where slow time and a meticulous attention to incongruous details suspends the will of his sovereign to make the plot progress.

The passage suggests that the two forms of exactitude are not simply in tension, but that formal logic courts its own rebuttal by empirical description, that any act of exact definition runs aground on its desire to account for everything. Much as Perec defines enumeration as an insuperable tension “between the exhaustive and the incomplete,” Calvino acknowledges that neither of these forms of exactitude “will reach absolute fulfillment”:

> the first because natural languages always say something more than formalized languages – they always carry a certain amount of noise that alters the essence of the information; and the second because in trying to account for the density and continuity of the world around us, language is exposed as lacunose, fragmentary: it always says something less than the sum of what can be experienced.

We might even say that the promise of complete knowledge is sustained precisely by the impossibility of its fulfillment. Perec goes on writing lists because no list can encompass a topic in its totality. For Calvino, exactitude is only possible to the degree that it remains tentative: “I see no other form of knowledge except that which is gained through successive approximations and corrections of mistakes.” 

*Invisible Cities* offers an example of successive approximations ... (Hesitancy. Doubt. Polo’s qualifications at the start of each section.)

> But above all I think of Francis Ponge, who with his little prose poems created a genre unique in contemporary literature: that very “exercise book” of the schoolboy who must first of all practice applying his words to the range of the world’s features, which he does with ::a series of attempts, rough drafts, approximations.::

Re: Invisible Cities.
“a successive juxtaposition of several pieces”
(Similar to Perec’s description of “Thoughts of Sorts.”):
Exhaustion & incompletion
> I only felt the need to continue until I had exhausted everything I had to say. In other words, I could only overcome the incompleteness of each discourse I attempted by adding other convergent or divergent discourses. If the book now seems like a fully worked out and rounded off construction, this construction came at the last minute on the basis of the material I had accumulated. The classification of the cities too, some of them (those of memory, of desire) were already clear from the start, because that was the way they had turned out, but others were …

“Why couldn’t there be, somehow, a new science for each object? ::A *mathesis singularis*:: (and no longer *universalis*)?”

> Many years later, in *La chambre claire* (*Camera Lucida*), Roland Barthes, another writer ::in whose mind the demons of exactitude and sensitivity cohabited::, wondered whether it was possible to imagine a science of the unique and unrepeatable: “Why couldn’t there be, somehow, a new science for each object? ::A *mathesis singularis*:: (and no longer *universalis*)?” (*Pourquoi n’y aurait-il pas, en quelque sorte, une science nouvelle par objet? Une Mathesis singularis et non plus universalis?*)“


<!---Say more about formal language, mathematics, computer science. *Mathesis singularis*. Make an explicit link to ekphrasis as a form of verbal description that evokes its object precisely through its own failure to capture that object. Lacunose, fragmentary. The relation between the sayable and the sensible. Revisit the relevant paragraph in version 1.0-->

<!--In the next section consider connecting this to your discussion of sampling and multiplicity re: the memo on lightness. And any other relevant remarks on multiplicity. Perhaps a third paragraph on poetry and Lucretius. The powder-fine dust of words. Calvino’s favorite metaphor for the multiplicity that formal logic (and discrete bianries) strive in vain to elide. THEN Palomar. Or you could weave this discussion into your reading of Palomar.-->
