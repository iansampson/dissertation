# mathesis singularis

Oscillating between the promise of exhaustive knowledge and the lure of a singular choice, Palomar embodies the paradox that Calvino (after Barthes) calls a “*mathesis singularis*.” He opposes this concept to the *mathesis universalis* (or universal science) imagined by Leibniz in his 1695 treatise of the same name, a science that aspires to replace the imperfections of natural language with a formal language modeled on algebra and infinitesimal calculus. Insofar as the *mathesis universalis* builds upon Leibniz’s design for a *calculus ratiocinator* (which Norbert Wiener credits as the first computer), the call for a universal science anticipates the modern discipline of computer science as well as the propositional logic on which it depends. It is universal because it offers a finite grammar and definitive syntax for expressing every possible thought, formulating propositions in such a way that they can be computed and compared. When Palomar speaks of “complete, exhaustive knowledge [*una conoscenza completa, esaustiva*],” he echoes Perec’s definition of enumeration as a form caught “between the exhaustive and the incomplete”: just as enumeration dreams of encompassing all of its possible members in a closed set (a dream, as I argue in my first chapter, that is sustained precisely by the impossibility of its fulfillment), Palomar imagines that his desire for exhaustive knowledge “could be satisfied only by tasting all the varieties” of cheese: only by experiencing every flavor “could he establish a scale of preferences and tastes and curiosities and exclusions” (73). <!---The humor of this passage lies partly in the discrepancy between its trivial topic and its earnest-->

<!---lofty execution ...?-->

Formal logic is one of the two forms of exactitude that Calvino discerns when reflecting on the chessboard passage in *Invisible Cities*, what he calls “the mental space of disembodied rationality,” the space of geometric theorems 

 one form is “the mental space of bodiless rationality,” the space of geometrical theorems and abstract patterns


between the desire to measure cheese according to universal criteria (the word *scale* implying a quantitative standard that could determine inclusion or exclusion) and the fact that taste defies universal measurement: it is not the sort of thing that can be charted and classified. <!---See Agamben on taste and knowledge.--> As Agamben argues, taste is in profound tension with knowledge: ... 

The word *every* reminds us that even the most capacious list of samples (terminated, implicitly or explicitly, with an etcetera) is fated to remain incomplete: Palomar imagines himself perusing an encyclopedia of cheese classified by form (“bar of soap, cylinder, dome, ball”), consistency (“dry, buttery, creamy, veined, firm”), or seasonings (“raisins, pepper, walnuts, sesame seeds, herbs, molds”), but these lists are but tidbits and morsels of the buffet they strive in vain to encompass.


Palomar compensates for the fact that he is not permitted to taste any of the cheeses (a curious detail at a cheese museum, given that venues as diverse as wine tastings and supermarkets commonly offer customers free samples of cheese <!---as one uses cheese to snare mice--> – a detail that fortifies his sense that the cheese museum is a gallery and the cheese platters are works of art that can be seen but not touched) by sampling the names of cheeses instead. Barthes describes gastronomy as a twofold delight that lusts after words as much as after food and drink ... In a similar fashion, Palomar vicariously enjoys the cheese he cannot sample by imbibing “names of cheeses, concepts of cheeses, meanings of cheeses, histories of cheeses, contexts of cheeses, psychologies of cheeses” (73). (And as Barthes observes that the refinement of *haut cuisine* there lurks the ravenous appetite which (aesthetic) taste seeks to elide, Palomar observes that “the olfactory organs has its moments of weakness, of loss of class, when the cheeses on their platters seem to proffer themselves as if on the divans of a brothel”: <!---Not really a defensible moment, comparing cheeses to sex workers – and as I point out in the earlier version it echoes another moment in another story where he’s comparing goose fat to the body of a woman ... The point I want to make here is his suggestion that the names of cheeses have a certain obscenity ... there’s a pleasure in just *naming* cheese:-->:

> A perverse grin flickers in the satisfaction of debasing the object of one’s own gluttony with lowering nicknames: *crottin*, *boule de moine*, *bouton de culotte*. (72)

<!---But back to the idea of a *mathesis singularis*-->

The desire for knowledge of *every* cheese goes hand in hand with the structure of the queue in which customers pass by every cheese in turn, permitted to look but not to touch. This structure echoes the one we saw earlier in Polo’s pantomime across the surface of the chessboard: a human body that signifies in relation to its position on a grid – echoing both the discretization of gesture that Bernard Stiegler attributes to the invention of the assembly line (a notion that Ngai also takes up in her argument that the zany, inherited from the grotesque choreography of the *commedia dele arte*, has become the aesthetic concept most closely tied to <!---immaterial-->labor) and, at the same time, the operations that Kublai performs on the grid of the chessboard: the sequential time of formal logic. <!---One crucial difference between the assembly line and the queue at the cheese museum is that in the latter the patrons do not touch the cheese: their hands are free from the taint of work ... They peruse the cheese only with their eyes (a distance that occasions Palomar’s analogy between the cheese museum and an art gallery ... where he “feels as he does in the Louvre, behind every displayed object the presence of the civilization that has given it form and takes form from it” (73). (Footnote: This phrase echoes a similar one in *Invisible Cities*: ...). <!---Another difference is that the patrons move while the cheese remains motionless: they are flaneurs or artlovers moving through a space that has been constructed for them ... the cheese is motionless, still, like a work of sculpture ...)
 
<!---Say something about *form* here--->

The queue, in turn, ushers customers towards the cashier where they make their purchase: the moment when the cheeses, already rendered comparable by being placed next to each other in the glass counter (and exposed to the gaze of the patrons as they move past), and already subject to measurements and classifications, are finally reduced to commodities – to a form determined exclusively by their exchange value ... It is that moment when Palomar seizes up ...


 - ’pataphysics: a universal science of particulars
- enumeration
- humor: disjunct between formality and fromagerie
- but it’s also funny because cheese is not the sort of thing that can be counted in this way: taste is a matter of gradations, not discrete categories (which is what Barthes says in his reading of Brillat-Savarin)
- samples of the sorts of cheeses we might eat
- the lockstep of the queue and propositional logic
