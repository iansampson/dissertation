# Palimpsests of the Lyric: Jen Bervin’s *Nets*

Erasure is often described as an act of exposure. To erase is to disclose, to scratch away a surface and illuminate the secrets it conceals. One of the most canonical examples of the genre – Ronald Johnson’s 1976 *Ra dios*, an erasure of the first four books of *Paradise Lost* – compares its procedure to that of *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*, whose copper proofs Blake etched with nitric acid – or what he calls “printing in the infernal method by corrosives … melting apparent surfaces away and revealing the infinite which was hid.” Another classic of the genre, Tom Phillips’ *A Humament*, an erasure of W. H. Mallock’s 1892 penny-dreadful *A Human Document*, echoes this Blakeian prophecy in a line that describes the erasure itself: “that / which / he / hid / reveal I.” In *Reading the Illegible*, Craig Dworkin shows how erasure poetry often draws upon archeological metaphors in order to describe its procedure as an act of excavation or exhumation. Erasure poetry is an inherently suspicious genre to the extent that it seeks to unveil a hidden truth or latent subtext within its disarmingly familiar object. The analogy between erasure and exposure suggests that rereading and rewriting old texts serves less to make them say something new than to discover a ciphered message that was already there – or in Dworkin’s words – “the way in which the source text ... makes reference to the treatment that it has always implicitly contained” (135).

Although the word *erasure* implies the removal of text from a given source, the process of crafting an erasure poem begins with addition, not subtraction. Poets typically compose first drafts by marking sections to be erased (with pencils, pens, whiteout, or, in *A Humament*, with paint), telling typesetters and designers which parts to omit and which to retain (even if, as with *Nets*, the designer is the poet herself). The erasure adds something to the text it erases: a form of annotation or commentary on a text that is no longer extant, erasure supplements the original by revealing a message that was already there, but that only becomes legible, paradoxically, when everything around it is expunged.

It is for this reason that Dworkin describes the poetics of erasure as a logic of the supplement: the message revealed by erasure is already present in the original but appears as such only after the erasure has taken place. The erased text (which is secondary, belated, derivative) paradoxically appears to precede the original from which it derives. And the text that has been elided appears as a form of marginal commentary on the remaining text that it surrounds. In this way, the original appears to supplement the erased version rather than the other way around. The erased text, although just a fragment of the original, appears more complete, more cogent, when its surfeit material is removed. It is by subtracting rather than adding words – by reducing the text to a fragment – that erasure both completes and reveals the incompleteness of the original it succeeds. Erasure shares this supplementarity with other poetic genres that rewrite texts from the distant past: Bergvall’s “Via”, I have argued, calls into question the authority of Dante’s epic by reversing the intuitive relation between original and translation: the variety of translations reveals the ways in which the Italian text already differs from itself. Enumeration conceived more broadly is also supplementary to the degree that the list – ostensibly collated after the definition of its topic – ends up revealing that the topic itself is undefinable and inexhaustible, nothing more than the retroactive sum of all the members of the list. What erasure adds to these other forms of supplementary writing is the way it literalizes the act of negation: while the list implies a multiplicity of absent members through tropes of elision (the ellipse, the etcetera), erasure leaves the deletions as visible gaps on the page. Like symptomatic reading, erasure poetry establishes a topology of surface and depth in which the poet-as-critic unearths a latent signification within the source text by filtering out extraneous material and reconfiguring what remains. It is the implied distance between manifest text and latent content, between symptom and etiology, that gives this mode of critique its power, affording the critic a vantage outside or above the text from where its secrets can be descried.

<!---TODO: Add transition along the lines of: The idea that erasure poetry is the act of *discovering* something within another text has authorized/invited its interpretation as a kind of conceptual writing akin to other practices of sampling and appropriation.-->

Vanessa Place and Robert Fitterman, for example, begin their manifesto-like survey of conceptual writing, *Notes on Conceptualisms*, by asking whether erasure properly belongs to the genre at all:

> Depends on the end result, we agreed, more than the writing strategy itself: i.e., is the poet employing this technique to reach for a larger idea outside of the text, or is the poet primarily concerned with making a new poem out of the erased one with its own local meaning? Or, conversely, are both things happening, or don’t both things have to happen, or is there a ratio, a spectrum, of how much the new text relies on some kind of “thinkership” outside of the text itself?

Erasure is the example that drives the need for a more inclusive and more nuanced definition of the conceptual. This is partly because, unlike transcription (and more like enumeration or the writing of a lipogram), erasure can be performed in many different ways. Two poets erasing the same text would likely produce drastically different results. Or even the same poet erasing the same text: Tom Phillips’ *A Humament* is now in its fifth edition, and each edition traces a completely different path through its Victorian source text than the one before it. Why might this open-endedness disqualify erasure as a conceptual genre? Because conceptualism *stricto sensu* requires that no authorial decisions (or any decisions more organic than where to place a semicolon in a transcription of a source text) be left to chance. It is chance (or contingency) that allows vestiges of lyric expression to creep into the conceptual text unchecked. And it is chance that gives authors the freedom to erase texts in ways that lyricize or re-lyricize them as poetry – to “mak[e] a new poem out of the erased one with its own local meaning.” Is the erased text there to be read as a poem (that is, to be read at all, and read closely) or to be thought as a concept? Does the text invite a readership or a thinkership?

The question can be inverted: what makes erasure a constraint in the first place? For one, the poet can use no words that are not already on the page (or those she can make by partially erasing words, as Tom Phillips creates the protagonist Toge by erasing part of *together*). She cannot change the order or spacing of those words (although she can guide the reader to read clusters of words from top to bottom rather than left to right). And she cannot reorder the pages. Put simply, she cannot *add* anything. The set of all possible poems is already there: all she has to do (and all she can do) is choose one. It is this sense of potential that connects erasure to the Oulipo: just as Queneau’s *Poèmes* contains an enormous but finite number of possible sonnets, Shakespeare’s *Sonnets* contains an enormous but finite number of possible erasures. Rather than construct an elaborate machine for generating poems, erasure assumes that every poem (and every text) is already such a machine, and the poet is merely its operator. Erasure differs from other kinds of constraint in placing such emphasis on the act of selection: unlike the heroic struggle for *difficulté vanqué* that drives poems like *Eunoia*, erasure is an exercise in taste and discernment. (Which is not to say that erasure is easy or that its success is assured. The illusion of having extracted a poem wholesale from another page of text comes at the cost of many hours spent hair-splitting: the weighing up of one word or phrase against another, the careful balancing of space so that the poem both delights the reader’s eye and guides it fluidly across the page). It is in this sense, Place and Fitterman suggest, that erasure resembles the signature gesture of conceptualism, the art of plucking a readymade from a sea of existing text:

> Note the similarities between Kenneth Goldsmith’s appropriation triptych – *Traffic*, *The Weather*, and *Sports* – and Jen Bervin’s *Nets*, a book of poems that perform erasure on Shakespeare’s sonnets. Goldsmith adds the artist/author to the readymade quotidian, upping its art-quotient; Bervin subtracts the master from his masterpiece, author from authority.
<!---TODO: Add page number.-->

If erasure is an act of exposure that reveals the supplemental logic at the heart of the original (and thereby deconstructs its originality), it does so, according to Fitterman and Place, by revealing that the original is already a copy, a readymade – waiting to be reframed as an aesthetic object. The effect is amplified when the text being erased is itself aesthetic, even canonical: Bervin performs a Duchampian operation on the Sonnets by subtracting the words of their author (and therefore “the master from his masterpiece, author from authority”) while at same time asserting her own mastery over the poem, her own authorship, by appropriating and signing the Sonnets as her own.

<!---TODO: Bervin doesn’t agree. She doesn’t even agree with the term erasure.--->
<!---TODO: Find Marjorie Perloff quote about authority. Authorship.-->

But Bervin does not figure her erasure of Shakespeare as a form of mastery or authority – or even, for that matter, as an erasure at all. She is ambivalent about the fact that “*Nets* is often framed in conversations about conceptual writing,” a frame that threatens to reduce the book to a conceptual soundbite – “a palimpsest of Shakespeare’s sonnets” – and bracket close readings of the text itself, which runs against the grain of a movement that sees the gesture of appropriation, and not the texture of the appropriated text, as the proper object of critical reflection. Bervin’s ambivalence extends to the word *erasure* itself, partly because it suggests that the author of an erased text creates loss rather than registers a loss that is already there, a loss that is inherent in writing itself, and certainly already in Shakespeare. Choosing instead to “empathize with omission and the omitted,” Bervin writes against the grain of the erasure genre, where the act of erasure (like the act of appropriating the text to be erased) constitutes a tactic of estrangement, serving to *détourne* an archaic or canonical text that centuries of rereading and interpretation have rendered familiar and banal. Although the text does self-reflexively comment upon its procedure – and reveal the degree to which the language of erasure and loss already permeates Shakespeare’s sonnets – such moments serve less to posit a veiled origin within the text or to give the poet mastery over the material than to establish assemblages of relations among words that lack any definite center or vantage outside of the poem itself. In other words, these poems are more relational and less topographical, less archeological, than their predecessors, collapsing the sense of opposition (author/reader, original/copy, masterpiece/readymade) on which both conceptual writing and symptomatic reading stake their polemics.

“Via,” I have argued, unravels the *agon* of succession by flattening all of the Dante variations into a list without chronology – a list that also includes the original (thereby effacing its originality). *Nets* yields a similar effect by retaining Shakespeare’s text beneath and alongside her own (not *before*, as in a facing-page translation, where the original, printed on the *verso*, comes first). If anything, the order is reversed: printed in boldface, Bervin’s version is the foreground, the focal point, poised to capture the reader’s attention and shape her reading of the poem as a whole. Shakespeare’s version, by contrast, seems to fade into the background: although both texts occupy the same plane of the page (and even the same text block) – neither is technically in front of the other – the contrast between bold and halftone type evokes surface and depth, figure and ground. The erased text surrounds each poem like a marginal commentary, as if Bervin wrote the bold versions first and later filled in the whitespace with annotations – whose weight, fainter than graphite, makes them seem ephemeral, erasable. The original appears to come *after* its variant, a supplement that completes each poem and, at the same time, frames it as a fragment, a sample. Fragmentary and elusive, Bervin’s poems call out for elucidation, a call that Shakespeare’s words – now an afterthought, a postface – appear to answer.

*Nets* opens with a palimpsest of Sonnet 2 that modestly reflects upon the project as a whole:

<!---TODO: Make unbolded text grayscale.-->

> | When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
> | And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,
> | Thy youth’s proud livery, so gazed on now,
> | Will be **a** tattered **weed**, **of small worth** held:
> | Then being **asked** where all thy beauty lies,
> | Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
> | To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,
> | Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
> | How much more praise deserved thy beauty’s use,
> | If thou couldst answer, ‘This fair child of mine
> | Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,’
> | Proving his beauty by succession thine.
> | This were **to be new made** when thou art old,
> | And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.

Despite its distant echo of the Poundian injunction to make it new, the poem abjures the *agon* that such remaking implies. Unlike Pound, who imagines an active (read: virile) poet who acts upon passive material with transitive force, an act of will that reforges the past and *makes* the dead speak (whether they want to or not), Bervin frames her remaking in the passive voice: the Sonnets invite revision, they *ask* to be new made. At the same time, she erases Shakespeare’s comparison – one of the overarching polemics of the Sonnets as a whole – between poetic making and reproductive life: addressing a young man whose beauty is fated to fade, the poem promises to commemorate (and thereby immortalize) his beauty and, at the same time, incites him to bear a child through whom his image will live on (to “prov[e] his beauty by succession thine” [12]). To be remade is to not just to reproduce, but to *be* reproduced – to be written, copied, read, and rewritten, an iterative process that is – although Shakespeare takes pains to evade this conclusion – prone to error and deviation. The passive construction – “to be new made” – underscores this analogy between inscription and reproduction, between the mechanical and the organic: life, in the Sonnets, is an endless cycle of rewriting and reprinting, a lineage of copies, a genealogy of images. In this way, the Sonnets anticipate the history of their reception among poets and critics alike: when Harold Bloom argues in *The Anxiety of Influence* that Shakespeare embodies the origin of the Western canon, the Oedipal corpus that all modern writers must both imitate and usurp, he uses a metaphor that Shakespeare already explores in the Sonnets: that of writing as a form of inheritance or succession. Bervin inverts this logic: by framing her remaking of Shakespeare as an invitation rather than a transgression, erasing all mention of genealogy and shifting the referent of *made* from child to poem (amplifying the vehicle of Shakespeare’s metaphor while eliding its tenor), Bervin at once challenges the notion of writing as an anxiety of influence and suspends the reproductive logic on which this notion relies: that of the poem as a child through whom the beloved – his memory, his image, and his “warm blood” – will live on.
<!---TODO: Find citation for Bloom.--->

Sonnet 8 performs an even more radical erasure of this genealogical metaphor:

> | Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?
> | Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy;
> | Why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,
> | Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?
> | If the true concord of well-tunèd sounds.
> | By unions married, do offend thine ear,
> | They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
> | **In singleness the parts** that thou shouldst bear.
> | Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
> | **Strike**s each in each by mutual ordering;
> | Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,
> | Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing;
> | Whose **speechless song, being many, seeming one**,
> | Sings this to thee: ‘Thou single wilt prove none.’

The original sonnet turns upon a conceit between melody and marriage: the triad of “sire, and child, and happy mother” (with an allusion to the Holy Family and the Christian promise of eternal life) is a harmony of notes sounding in unison – the strings of a lute that, tuned to the same frequency, vibrate sympathetically without being plucked. The sonnet ends on a cautionary note: if the bachelor refuses to marry and bear children – who extend the duet of marriage into a choir of successors (a multitude that seems to form one line, one melody) – his solo performance will fade, and he will die alone (“Thou single will prove none”).[^single-none] As if fulfilling this morbid prediction, Bervin erases the young man whom Shakespeare addresses as well as the tenor of the musical conceit that urges him to marry. Without this frame, the conceit refers instead to the poem itself, whose parts – three fragmentary lines, separated by whitespace – strike in unison, a singularity composed of multiple parts. The poem is a “speechless song” not just in the banal sense that all lyric poetry courts analogy with music (a song, even by Shakespeare’s time, played to the tune of the printing press rather than that of the lyre), but because erasure composes a new song out of the Sonnets by rendering Shakespeare selectively mute. Together, the remaining lines and the stricken text form another pair of strings that vibrate in unison: the erasure describes not just its own parts but also the relation between source and revision, between Shakespeare and Bervin, between a world that knows only “well-tunèd” music and one that is no stranger to dissonance.[^radios-music] *Strike* becomes more forceful in this context: not just to pluck a string or strike a bell, but to excise text from a record, to flag redactions with a strikethrough font, and – more radically – to refuse to work (another form of union that joins many into one). Bervin’s *désœuvrement* of Sonnet 8 strikes out its reproductive logic – its conceit of harmony as family and melody as succession – for a more capacious notion of the *many* as a multitude, a form of being-in-common that *seems* one without eliding the difference, the *singleness*, that makes each part unique. *Being many* (with a distant echo of George Oppen’s *Being Numerous*) amplifies Bervin’s remark in the postface that poetry is inherently multiple, that every poem carries vestiges of anonymous others:

> I stripped Shakespeare’s sonnets bare to the “nets” to make the space of the poems open, porous, possible—a divergent elsewhere. When we write poems, the history of poetry is with us, pre-inscribed, in the white of the page; when we read or write poems, we do it with or against this palimpsest.

Bervin reverses the normative relation between singularity and multiplicity: the point is not that marriage makes one of many (or many of two) – that two individuals, joined in matrimony, become the font of a lineage – but rather that one is *already* many, that every singular text is inherently multiple because it permits (or even invites) a countless assemblage of possible readings and rewritings. As with “Via,” where the divergent paths of Dante translations reveal a self-difference at work in the original Italian (which the poem presents as one of its own variations), Bervin implies that her erasure of the Sonnets could be one of many, that another poet, or indeed herself, could find a myriad of different poems hidden within the same text. *Nets* reimagines the Sonnets as one node in a network rather than an origin from which all others derive, a community of poets and multiplicity of poems that erasure reveals to be, in the words of the postface, “open, porous, possible – a divergent elsewhere.” She abjures the teleology of reproduction (both poetic and organic) for the relationality of the palimpsest. She does not rewrite Shakespeare so much as write over (and therefore with and through) a text that lives on through its own erasure.

In this sense, *palimpsest* is both a metaphor for intertextuality writ large – “all that sets the text in a relationship, whether obvious or concealed, with other texts,” as Gérard Genette observes in his magisterial study of the subject (*Palimpsests* 1) – and a physical affordance of inscriptive media, which can literally be erased and overwritten (although the line between the literal and the figurative – given that the palimpset-as-metaphor almost always appears in writing – proves difficult if not impossible to enforce). Bervin contends that all texts are palimpsests, that all writing is relational: erasure merely brings to the surface the net of interwoven links that makes a canon more than the sum of its archives. It is because the Sonnets are ductile enough to morph and adapt to their future readers – poets and critics alike (who in turn carve their own paths among their myriad figures and forms) – that they survive, altered, if not by Bervin’s scalpel, then by the shifting contexts and shifting paradigms in and through which they continue to be read.

But calling *Nets* a palimpsest also recalls that Shakespeare, like other early modern writers, used a more palpable kind of erasable medium, one that informs the complex interplay between memory, inscription, and erasure in the Sonnets. A descendent of the wax tablet of antiquity (no longer in widespread use after the rise of paper notebooks), the erasable tablets used in early modern England consisted of pasteboard coated with a mixture of gesso and glue, making a surface from which ink, graphite, or silverpoint – with the help of a sponge or a wet fingertip – could be easily erased (Stallybrass 388). Erasable notebooks were used to record information that writers could edit and bridge before copying it into the more durable (and more expensive) medium of the codex. As a metaphor for human memory, the erasable tablet suggests that the ability to remember presupposes (and converges with) the ability to forget: Hamlet, for example, appearing onstage with just such a tablet in hand (and poised to deliver his most famous soliloquy), vows to obey the ghost’s command – “Remember me” – by erasing from his mind all trivial thoughts:

> Yea, from the Table of my Memory,
> Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records,
> All sawes of Books, all formes, all presures past,
> That youth and obseruation coppied there;
> And thy Commandment all alone shale liue
> Within the Booke and Volume of my Braine,
> Vnmixt with baser matter.

Hamlet opposes two models of memory – the trivial palimpsest and the durable codex – but the binary is short-lived: after Act III, the ghost no longer appears onstage – and it is the jester Yorick, not King Hamlet, whose death the prince goes on to commemorate. The book of the brain proves as vulnerable and ephemeral as the erasable surface it promises to supplant: if Hamlet, at a whim, can excise the trivia of his youth, nothing prevents his father’s memory from fading away in turn. Erasable tables “work only because they make writing *impermanent* (Stallybrass 415): they are “memorial prostheses” that paradoxically “memorialize the ability to forget” (Stallybrass 413). Both as a metaphor for human memory and as a medium of literary inscription, the palimpsest is able to encode information only by presupposing its loss: it is only because memory can be rewritten *over* that it can written (or read) at all:

> Such a supplement suggests the difficulty of making any complete separation between remembering and forgetting. A technology of memory, the tables are also a technology of erasure. (Stallybrass 417)

<!---TODO: Make this a new paragraph.--->
A fitting analogy for Hamlet’s melancholy – a compulsive mourning that, unlike grief, seeks to preserve the lost object by rehearsing the impossibility of its return – the palimpsest also embodies the commemorative economy of the Sonnets, which promise to keep the memory of the beloved alive by endlessly lamenting his mortality. Sonnet 122 meditates upon a gift that the poet has received from his beloved – an erasable table – and muses that, although memories inscribed on this physical medium will fade, the memory of the beloved inscribed in his own brain will not. Echoing Hamlet’s fraught attempt to distinguish between durable and erasable forms of memory, the poet is forced to concede that human memory is only as permanent as the mortal body it inhabits: “Till each [brain and heart] to razed oblivion yield his part / Of thee, thy record never can be missed.” The poem concludes by dismissing the need for “an adjunct to remember thee”: a supplement that vouchsafes the memory of the beloved by reducing him to a fragment that also threatens, as the next line observes, to “import forgetfulness,” to rely upon a medium that is inherently prone to decay – an idea that has already been undercut by the image of human memory as itself a form of inscription, a writing on the body: “Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain / Full charactered with lasting memory.” In the end, the poem fails to allay the fear that memory might be as supplemental, as prosthetic, and ultimately as erasable as the adjunct medium it purports to replace.

<!---A palimpsest is always many, always multiple: because it can be written over again and again, and each writing bears traces of the last.-->

The early modern medium of the erasable notebook – and the economy of erasure and reinscription that surrounds it – finds a ready counterpart in the more contemporary forms of artificial memory that inform the composition of *Nets*. Wendy Chun makes this connection in her influential study of digital memory as an “enduring ephemeral”:

> If computer memory is like anything, it is like erasable writing; but, if a penciled word can be erased because graphite is soft, a computer’s memory can be rewritten because its surface constantly fades.

What makes new media *new*, Chun goes on to argue, is less their superhuman speed or power than their reliance upon physical media – cathode tubes, mercury lines, and even flash storage – that constantly erase and rewrite the information they promise to retain. If digital media seem both less solid and more durable than analog media (a paradox embodied by the figure of the cloud – at once ephemeral and transcendent), that is because they elide the cycles of decay and renewal, the constant flicker of electrical charges, that make digital information – despite all the hype – both highly volatile and seemingly inert. The fantasy of digital memory as an impregnable archive follows from a conflation of regenerative memory with static memory, or, more simply, of memory with storage:

> Crucially, memory is an active process, not static. A memory must be held in order to keep it from moving or fading. Memory does not equal storage. While memory looks backward, according to the OED, to store is to furnish, to build stock.
<!---TODO: Add a couple concluding sentences on Chun.-->

In this sense, artificial memory (and especially digital memory) is also melancholic: it preserves an object by means of its continual erasure. Hu explores the connection between melancholy and digital memory in an essay on data bunkers (which pre-empt the threat of cyberattacks or obsolete media by obsessing guarding their object, which are already subject to decay):

> Melancholy, in short, is something of a preservative. A crypt is created within the psyche that conceals a trace of the lost object, a libidinal space that simultaneously sets the object apart – marks it as belonging to the realm of the dead or gone – but also keeps a version of it alive. Lodged like a parasite inside the subject, the phantom remains inaccessible and encoded as it waits for its eventual reincarnation (or, at least, its decryption).

Hu describes digital media as a thanatopoetics that promises to safeguard our data against external threats even as it confronts us with dead media – dead harddrives, dead hyperlinks, and fatal errors – that mark the ground where our seemingly immortal data, if not precisely lost, has become forever irretrievable. If the wispy metaphor of the cloud promises to make information transcendent, it also conceals the server farms and concrete bunkers (often repurposed fallout shelters) that seek to preserve our data indefinitely by rehearsing the inevitability of its loss: built to withstand physical damage from without, the bunkers fail to forestall the inevitable decay of magnetic drives that store out data and the inevitable obsolesce of the formats that encode it. No longer a shelter, the bunker becomes a tomb.

If *Nets* is a work of new media poetry, then, it is less because it performs the conceptualist gesture of sampling and remixing existing text than because, as a palimpsest of a text that is itself concerned with artificial memory, it reveals how both the Sonnets and contemporary digital culture figure memory as a form of compulsive reinscription. Recalling that data is nothing other than an object of memory (literally what has been given, *les données*, as I observe in my first chapter), *Nets* responds by showing that loss, erasure, and forgetting are inscribed in our media, inherent qualities of inscription itself.

<!---TODO: Make transition here.-->

The distinction that Chun makes between *memory* and *store* –and which, she argues, the fantasy of the immaterial data erases – animates Sonnet 64, where Shakespeare compares the youthful beauty of the beloved to a hoard of riches whose abundance – appearing to vouchsafe its future – makes it all the more vulnerable to decay. It is also the most uncanny poem in *Nets*, seeming to presage – more than four centuries in advance – the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center:

> | When **I have seen** by Time’s fell hand defaced
> | The rich proud cost of outworn buried age,
> | When sometime lofty **towers** I see **down-razed**,
> | And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
> | When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
> | Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
> | And the firm soil win of the wat’ry main,
> | Increasing store with **loss** and **loss** with store;
> | When I have seen such interchange of state,
> | Or state itself confounded to decay,
> | Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate––
> | That Time will come and take my love away.
> | This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
> | But weep to have that which it fears to lose.

By removing the *and* between *loss* and *loss*, Bervin makes the doubled word *loss* into an image of the twin towers – or perhaps the patches of empty sky that bear witness to their destruction. Like Kenneth Goldsmith’s *The Day* – a transcription of the New York Times edition published the morning of 9/11, which contains uncanny premonitions of the catastrophe that, at the time of printing, had yet to strike – Bervin unearths, buried in the rubble of Shakespeare’s verse, a lament for events that will not unfold for another four centuries. The emphasis falls less on the razing of the towers, however, and more on the duplication of loss – a sort of *fort da* game that seeks to revive what is lost by repeating the word that marks its absence. The deletion of *and* removes *loss* from any form of relation: one experiences loss only through repetition, never through conjunction – only through the disjunct, the cut, of parataxis. That cut extends from the spatial to the temporal: the poem disrupts chronological time by projecting loss into the past, a past that precedes not only the loss itself but also the construction of its object.

<!---TODO: Quote remark from editor. Loss *increases* store.-->
The original line – “Increasing store with loss and loss with store” – forms a chiasmus in which *store* increases (rather than diminishes) the potential for loss: the more you have, the more you have to lose. The sonnet goes on to suggest, however, that this loss is reversible – not by amassing more of the same, but by entrusting the memory of the beloved to a medium more suited to its preservation: poetry – and the minds of its living readers – abjures loss by re-inscribing the lost object in memory (and, through grief, the memory of its loss) – a medium that outlives any manmade structure, any tower that time or fortune will inevitably raze to the ground. Bervin erases this bittersweet consolation, trading *store* for *loss*, memory for melancholy. She short-circuits what Jahan Ramazani calls the “compensatory economy” of elegy – one moment grieving the dead, the next announcing that the dead live on – by erasing both the solace of commemoration and the promise of resurrection. What lives on is loss itself, or the twin words *loss*, the remainders of an erasure that they alone survive to document.

*Nets* transforms the Sonnets’ praise for the power of poetry to immortalize the beloved (by figuring reproductive life as a form of endless reinscription) into an elegy for the possibility of enduring memory and for the lyric voice that performs the labor of commemoration. Where the Sonnets play upon an opposition between the threat of loss (a double threat: of dying in obscurity and of dying without children) and the promise of immortality – and of a medium durable enough to let one live on indefinitely – *Nets* lops off the second half of this dialectic and leaves nothing but loss (or twin *losses*) in its wake.[^sestet-octet] It is easy to read this emphasis on loss as a reflexive comment on the act of erasure (and therefore as a veiled origin, an uncanny prediction of the erasure procedure itself). But loss also resonates in these poems with a melancholia that compulsively refuses to give up its object – because that object can only be preserved by means of a constant re-inscription.
<!---TODO: Emphasize the connection here between the enduring ephemeral and the commemorative economy of elegy – both of which are melancholic. They preserve an object by endlessly re-inscribing its loss.-->

<!---TODO: Transition. It’s also about the lyric.-->

In elegy, as David Shaw keenly observes, the poet’s own death is always at stake. And because death is an experience that delimits – and so is excluded from – life (the Epicurian paradox: “when death comes, we no longer are”), elegies that intimate the death of the self inevitably invoke the ineffable: unable to imagine (and therefore mourn) their own death, poets instead lament the impossibility of mourning. This paradox also animates Bervin’s palimpsest of Sonnet 63, where the manifold senses of erasure at play in the book (of life, of memory, and of media) converge:

> | Against my love shall be as **I am** now
> | With Time’s injurious hand crushed and o’er worn;
> | When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
> | With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
> | Hath travelled on to age’s steepy night,
> | And all those beauties whereof now he’s king
> | Are **vanishing or vanished** out of sight,
> | Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
> | For such a time do I now fortify
> | Against confounding age’s cruel knife,
> | That he shall never cut from memory
> | My sweet love’s beauty, though my lover’s life;
> | His beauty shall **in these black lines** be seen,
> | And they shall live, and he in them still green.

Like many of the sonnets that precede it, Shakespeare’s text laments the fact that the youth’s beauty will fade until he is as old and withered as the poet himself (when “my love shall be as I am now / with Time’s injurious hand crushed and o’er worn”) and promises, in the sestet, to redeem this loss by reviving him (or rather his “beauty,” a bittersweet compensation for the loss of his life), “which shall in these black lines be seen, / And they shall live, and he in them still green.” Bervin erases everything in the sonnet that contributes to this redemptive promise: she turns a love poem into an elegy (or reveals that it already was an elegy), but also makes the mourning reflexive: unmoored from any object that might give it purpose, from the commemorative economy between lover and beloved, the bereaved and the grievable, the lyric I mourns only itself.

<!---But she also does so by calling attention to erasure as a *medium*. Vanishing. Black lines. The boldface.-->

<!--And here’s where *Nets* pushes back against conceptualism. She doesn’t subtract the author from authorship, the master from the masterpiece – a structure that leaves the lyric I intact while erasing the person whose experience that I is imagined to express – (*I* erased Shakespeare, I am the author ... I signed the book). This structure implies a temporality: the conceptualist who appropriates Shakespeare and signs her own name to the Sonnets come *after* Shakespeare, in his wake, and in a sense – a very Bloomian sense – kills him. Usurps him. Conceptualism is still enmeshed in the *agon* of succession. Perhaps more so than any other movement. But Bervin rather imagines erasure a process of continual vanishing and re-inscription, where there is no *after*, no endpoint or vantage from which she can look back at the Sonnets and make them hers, because they are already re-inscriptive, they are stuck in a melancholic loop, keeping Shakespeare alive by mourning his loss.-->

<!---What this poem does – I want to argue – is bring together the paradox (or tension or whatever) inherent in inscriptive media whereby memory is preserved by means of an erasure ++you need to establish this earlier in the argument++ erasability is a condition of memory ++that’s an argument that needs to precede this poem++ and the commemorative economy of the elegy (especially of self-elegy) where the self can be preserved *through* lamenting the impossibility of its preservation ++and also – in a more compensatory or redemptive form of elegy – brought back to life … In Bervin’s case – this logic is subverted: there is no binary of grievable(or lost)/bereaved, living/dead, before/after, victim/survivor, mourned/mourner, etc. in which the one who *comes* after is burdened with the power to keep the dead alive in his/her imagination. That’s not the economy at work in *Nets* – because, by making this analogy between inscriptive media and elegiac commemoration – the dead are *always* being brought back to life, they’re always dead *and* alive, *vanishing* *and* vanished (the or being a boolean *or*, a conjoint set / not a binary *or*: THIS *or* THAT – exclusive): they alive in/sa/through being dead.-->

<!---TODO: Add something about repair, especially in these two final sonnets. It’s not all just deconstructing loss. Not all melancholia. Well, maybe, yes.-->

<!---This impossibility, this division, this sublimity disrupts the commemorative economy of the elegy: its desire to raise the dead. *Nets* disrupts its elegiac impulses in a similar way.-->

<!---Connect this analysis to new media and artificial memory.-->

<!---Storage, unlike memory,-->

<!---Shakespeare opposes two forms of inscriptive memory: the erasable and the durable (which Sonnet 122 compares to the tablet and the codex) – that he struggles to keep distinct: the more material possessions one stores, the more one has to lose, but poetry – a form of living memory, continually re-inscribed in the minds of readers – keeps the image of the beloved alive by endlessly commemorating his loss.-->
<!---TODO: There is no poetry in this poem. You’re thinking of a different poem. Was this note originally attached to a different sonnet?-->

<!---TODO: Add citation from Genette about erasure as a “choice of attention.”-->


<!---MARK: Footnotes-->

[^single-none]: The final line paraphrases a proverb derived from Aristotle’s *Metaphysics*, giving the musical conceit a mathematical resonance (music being one the four arts of the scholastic *quadrivium*: the study of number and time). One is not a number, according to Aristotle, because one is a unit and a number is a multitude of units: the two are distinct substances.
<!---TODO: Add reference to Shakespeare edition.-->

[^radios-music]: Bervin is not alone in forging an analogy between erasure and music. Ronald Johnson compares *Ra dios*, his erasure of *Paradise Lost* – and arguably the most canonical example of the genre – to the Baroque Variations of Lucas Foss, who creates new compositions from old classics by selectively muting notes. In words that could also describe *Nets*, Johnson cites Foss on his rendition of Handel’s Concerto Grosso, Op. 6, No. 12.:

    > Groups of instruments play the Larghetto but keep submerging into inaudibility (rather than pausing). Handel’s notes are always present but often inaudible. The inaudible moments leave holes in Handel’s music (I composed the holes). (ix)

<!---TODO: Add an anchor for this footnote somewhere.-->
[^sestet-octet]: The Shakespearean sonnet inscribes this paradox in its very form: the sestet resolves the crux posed by the octet – that death is inevitable – by presenting poetry as the medium that will let the beloved live forever: the poem ends precisely with the promise of continuity.
