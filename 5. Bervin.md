# Palimpsests of the Lyric: Jen Bervin’s *Nets*

Erasure is often described as an act of exposure. To erase is to disclose, to scratch away a surface and illuminate the secrets it conceals. One of the most canonical examples of the genre – Ronald Johnson’s 1976 *Ra dios*, an erasure of the first four books of *Paradise Lost* – compares its procedure to that of *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*, whose copper proofs Blake etched with nitric acid – or what he calls “printing in the infernal method by corrosives … melting apparent surfaces away and revealing the infinite which was hid.” Another classic of the genre, Tom Phillips’ *A Humament*, an erasure of W. H. Mallock’s 1892 penny-dreadful *A Human Document*, echoes this Blakeian prophecy in a line that describes the erasure itself: “that / which / he / hid / reveal I”. In *Reading the Illegible*, Craig Dworkin shows how erasure poetry often draws upon archeological metaphors in order to describe its procedure as an act of excavation or exhumation. Erasure poetry is an inherently suspicious genre to the extent that it seeks to unveil a hidden truth or latent subtext within its disarmingly familiar object. The analogy between erasure and exposure suggests that rereading and rewriting old texts serves less to make them say something new than to discover a ciphered message that was already there – or in Dworkin’s words – “the way in which the source text ... makes reference to the treatment that it has always implicitly contained” (135).

Although the word *erasure* implies the removal of text from a given source, the process of crafting an erasure poem begins with addition, not subtraction. Poets typically compose first drafts by marking sections to be erased (with pencils, pens, whiteout, or, in *A Humament*, with paint), telling typesetters and designers which parts to omit and which to retain (even if, as with *Nets*, the designer is the poet herself). The erasure adds something to the text it erases: a form of annotation or commentary on a text that is no longer extant, erasure supplements the original by revealing a message that was already there, but that only becomes legible, paradoxically, when everything around it is expunged.

It is for this reason that Dworkin describes the poetics of erasure as a logic of the supplement: the message revealed by erasure is already present in the original but appears as such only after the erasure has taken place. The erased text (which is secondary, belated, derivative) paradoxically appears to precede the original from which it derives. And the text that has been elided appears as a form of marginal commentary on the remaining text that it surrounds. In this way, the original appears to supplement the erased version rather than the other way around. The erased text, although just a fragment of the original, appears more complete, more cogent, when its surfeit material is removed. It is by subtracting rather than adding words – by reducing the text to a fragment – that erasure both completes and reveals the incompleteness of the original it succeeds. Erasure shares this supplementarity with other poetic genres that rewrite texts from the distant past: Bergvall’s “Via”, I have argued, calls into question the authority of Dante’s epic by reversing the intuitive relation between original and translation: the variety of translations reveals the ways in which the Italian text already differs from itself. Enumeration conceived more broadly is also supplementary to the degree that the list – ostensibly collated after the definition of its topic – ends up revealing that the topic itself is undefinable and inexhaustible, nothing more than the retroactive sum of all the members of the list. What erasure adds to these other forms of supplementary writing is the way it literalizes the act of negation: while the list implies a multiplicity of absent members through tropes of elision (the ellipse, the etcetera), erasure leaves the deletions as visible gaps on the page. Like symptomatic reading, erasure poetry establishes a topology of surface and depth in which the poet-as-critic unearths a latent signification within the source text by filtering out extraneous material and reconfiguring what remains. It is the implied distance between manifest text and latent content, between symptom and etiology, that gives this mode of critique its power, affording the critic a vantage outside or above the text from where its secrets can be descried.
