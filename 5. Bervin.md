# Palimpsests of the Lyric: Jen Bervin’s *Nets*

<!---TODO: Write introduction.--->

### Corrosive Poetics

Poets and critics alike often figure erasure as an act of exposure, unveiling a hidden text beneath the surface of the original. In his preface to the 1976 edition of *Radi os*, an erasure of the first four books of *Paradise Lost*, Ronald Johnson compares his procedure to the one that William Blake uses to craft his illuminated books:

> [*Radi os*] is the book that Blake gave me (as Milton entered Blake’s left foot – the first foot, that is, to exit Eden), his eyes wide open through my hand. *To etch* is “to cut away,” and each page, as in Blake’s concept of a book, is a single picture. (ix)

A visual artist as well as a poet, Johnson alludes to Blake’s practice of etching copperplates with nitric acid, a way of reproducing multicolor books by hand without the prohibitive cost of printing by letterpress. As an analogy for poetic erasure, corrosive engraving oscillates between addition and subtraction, creation and destruction, which Blake’s version of the technique enacts in three major phases: first, the etcher draws on the plate with a protective liquid; second, he dips the plate in aquafortis, corroding the parts of the surface that remain exposed and leaving behind a relief or intaglio inscribed in the copper; and third, he inks the plate and presses it onto the page, imprinting a positive (albeit reversed) copy of the original drawing.[^blake-method] Recalling that etching is a form of excision (from German *ätzen*, cognate with *eat*), Johnson emphasizes the subtractive dimension of this practice: the aquafortis (technically called a *mordant*, that which bites) creates a singular impression, “a single picture,” by eating away the superfluous material in which it is embedded. But Blake also adds something to the plate – the *mordant*, before corroding the copper, forms a supplemental layer, an outer film – and the final stereotype, in turn, serves to print new copies, to reproduce an existing image. In *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell*, Blake plays with this additive valence of corrosion by suggesting that acid, rather than simply effacing its medium, also reveals a subtext that is otherwise invisible:

> But first the notion that man has a body distinct from his soul, is to be expunged; this I shall do by printing in the infernal method, by corrosives, which in Hell are salutary and medicinal, melting apparent surfaces away, and displaying the infinite which was hid. (xxii)

<!---TODO: Consider adding footnote on Phillips. “That which he hid / reveal I.-->

For Blake, corrosive reproduction is a revelatory act: the infernal printer does not so much *create* new works as discover, like a sculptor chipping away a raw block of marble, a hidden form that lies latent beneath its surface. When Johnson compares his excision of *Paradise Lost* to Blakeian intaglios, he suggests that erasure, more than corrupting or eroding the original, unveils an even more originary text concealed within its core.

Critics have made much of this analogy between poetic erasure and corrosive engraving. In *Reading the Illegible*, Craig Dworkin writes that “the technique of treatment in *Radi Os* is not unrelated to Blake’s own mode of book production,” citing the way that descriptions of infernal acid in the poem “rhyme with Blake’s similar metatextual references to processes by which he created his extraordinary illuminated books” (214). In his afterword to *Radi os*, Guy Davenport elaborates upon Johnson’s allusion to Blake, recalling that the latter also rewrote *Paradise Lost*, first as *Vala, or A Dream of Nine Nights* and again in his epic *Milton* (94).[^blake-illustrations] (Dworkin adds that the frontispiece of the latter, originally printed as “[MILT ON]{.smallcaps}”, resembles the split title of *Radi os*, itself a fragment of the letters in *Paradise Lost* [214].) For Davenport, Johnson continues Blake’s own project of “correcting and amplifying Milton” (94), except that, having corrected (or redacted) most of the original, he abstains from adding anything new. As Travis MacDonald echoes this rhetoric in arguing that, “where Blake saw fit to *amplify* Milton, *Radi os* is concerned instead with *muting* [him]” (51). Davenport goes on to figure erasure as a sort of excavation:

<!---TODO: Consider disambiguing Dworkin quote above by using short title: *Illegible*. Or just quote the passage.-->

> The poem we are reading is still Milton’s, but sifted. The spare scattering of words left on the page continues to make a coherent poem, Milton *imagiste*. (Wordsworth and Blake did the same thing to the poem, except that they filled up the spaces again with their own words.) (100)

Like an archeologist, Davenport implies, Johnson *sifts* an *imagiste* poem out of the baroque rubble of the original. Erasure is a matter of discovery (or rather *invention*, in the etymological sense of the word, which, as Davenport observes, means finding again): “He found a poem inside another poem. All he had to do was remove the superfluous words” (103). Dworkin draws a more explicit analogy between poetic erasure and archeological discovery, arguing that texts like *Radi os* register a profound sense – already at work in Milton’s “postlapsarian epic” – of “entropic loss, eliminating and erasing their source texts like the erosion and decomposition of mineral structures” (132). Although *erosion* implies an organic process that unfolds without the interference of an external actor, Dworkin also suggests that Johnson catalyzes and accelerates this process in an effort to unearth a poem that lies buried beneath the surface: “Johnson combs Milton’s text to disentangle his own text lost inside it” (129). Steve McCaffery similarly describes *Radi os* as “a poem found among unlinked words and phrasal in the opening four books of *Paradise Lost*,” a process of “finding and extracting” that “presents an unfamiliar text within a text, present in *Paradise Lost* but via habitual reading unseen” (124). McCaffery goes on to relate this archeological metaphor of erasure as extraction to the Blakean practice of acidic engraving:

> *Radi os*, as Blake’s gift to Johnson, is the product of a corrosive poetics, a relief composition transposing Blake’s graphic method into typographic textuality, burning away large areas of the surface text with the aquafortis of Johnson’s own imagination. Utilizing his source poem as a lexical supply of selected deletions and excavations takes place to arrive at Johnson’s own poem as a reduced, alembicated form of *Paradise Lost*. (125)

Note the use of *excavation* here (like Davenport’s *sifting*): although McCaffery stresses the “negativity involved in this method as a production through *loss*,” he also suggests that erasure uncovers something that was already there, or, with another metaphor, “a reduced, alembicated form of *Paradise Lost*,” an essence that has been distilled, purified, from the ore of the original. 

Corrode, erode, disentangle, distill: all of these metaphors characterize poetic erasure as a revelatory (or paranoid) practice that seeks to unveil a hidden truth or latent subtext within a canonical poem. The analogy between erasure and exposure suggests that rereading and rewriting disarmingly familiar texts serves less to make them say something new than to discover a ciphered message that was already there – or in Dworkin’s words – “the way in which the source text ... makes reference to the treatment that it has always implicitly contained” (135).

At the same time, however, erasure adds something to the text it erases: a form of annotation or commentary on a text that is no longer extant, erasure supplements the original by revealing a message that is latent in the text but that only becomes legible when everything around it is expunged. This is partly a constraint imposed by the medium. Erasure poets typically compose first drafts by marking sections to be erased (with pencils, pens, whiteout, or, in *A Humament*, with paint), telling typesetters and designers which parts to omit and which to retain (even if, as with *Nets*, the designer is the poet herself). In an interview for the *Chicago Review*, Johnson recalls how he composed *Radi os* by writing directly on the page: “I went to the bookstore and bought *Paradise Lost*. And I started crossing out” (43). Asked about his progress on later sections of the epic – *Radi os* ends with Book [IV]{.smallcaps} – he answers: “I’ve done [V]{.smallcaps} and I’ve pencilled in up to [VIII]{.smallcaps}” (44). That the omissions are pencilled *in* rather than crossed *out*, that erasure is a form of annotation as well as a form of excision, also shapes how readers encounter the finished work. The first review of *Radi os*, published by William Harmon in 1981, compares the experience of reading the text to “the migraine-provoking chore of looking at a library book that some fool has ‘high-lighted’ with one of those pink or yellow marking pens (225). Beyond the rather banal accusation that Johnson defaces Milton (a charge leveled at countless other avant-garde revisions of canonical texts), Harmon observes that the words on the page, against a whitespace filled with the imagined backdrop of Milton’s epic, appear as highlights superimposed on the original, much as Johnson pencils in the passages he intends to preserve. This additive or supplementary dimension of erasure forms part of the paratext of *Radi os*: the front matter includes a draft of the first page of *Paradise Lost* with the excised letters faded but still visible, so that the words preserved by Johnson seem to be printed over the original text (iv). In “Corrosive Poetics,” McCaffery cites this page but replaces the faded text with a strikethrough font, observing that erasure involves “a fundamental negativity ... a production through *loss*” (125), even though his own reproduction of the text in a block quote calls attention to the fact that erasure (whether by printing in strikethrough or corroding with acid) typically involves adding another material to the text in order to mark what words or passages are to be redacted.

<!---TODO: Conclude this paragraph. Remove McCaffery repetition or at least contextualize differently.--->

With an eye to the material affordances of erasure, Dworkin argues that such works exhibit a sort of supplemental logic in which the erased text (which is secondary, belated, or derivative) paradoxically appears to precede the original from which it derives. Dworkin cites the protagonist of *A Humament*, Bill Toge, whose surname is a fragment of a half-erased *together*, as “a perfect emblem of this constantly shifting dynamic of presence and absence”:

> Whatever his associations with loss and rupture, Toge is also an index of supplementary. If not, by itself, a familiar English word, “toge” is the conventional transliteration of the common Russian word *тоже*: “also,” “as well as,” “too.” Like most of the works discussed in this book, that “also” is the hallmark of the treated text’s appropriation. Keeping both source and derivative simultaneously in view, and making visible the traces of that doubled presence, the treated text is less a parasite on its source than a pair of sights. (136)

A pair of sights, that is, because the experience of reading erasure poetry is inherently binocular, where the original and its erasure are visible side by side, if not always in perfect focus. The whitespace where text has been erased continues to surround, like a marginal commentary, the text that remains. In this way, erasure reverses the intuitive relation between text and paratext, original and supplement: on the one hand, the remaining text, a cluster of words enclosed in whitespace, exhibits the authority of a body text, a framed artifact; on the other, the whitespace calls to mind the erased original (as Harmon suggests in comparing *Radi os* to a highlighted library book), an absent trace that appears to supplement (and therefore to follow or derive from) the body text it enframes. The fragment paradoxically appears more complete, more cogent, than the original it supplants, a refined or purified core (“Milton *imagiste*,” as Davenport says of *Radi os*), and the original, by comparison, resembles a baroque imitation that amplifies the original with needless additions. On the one hand, for all of these critics, erasure establishes a topology of surface and depth in which the poet unearths a latent signification within the source text by filtering out (or *sifting*) extraneous material. On the other hand, as Dworkin observes, erasure supplements and supplants the original, calling its originality into question and revealing the degree to which the source text is itself fragmentary and incomplete.

<!--Erasure shares this supplementarity with other poetic genres that rewrite texts from the distant past. Bergvall’s “Via,” I have argued, calls into question the authority of Dante’s epic by reversing the intuitive relation between original and translation: the variety of translations reveals the ways in which the Italian text already differs from itself. Enumeration conceived more broadly is also supplementary to the degree that the list – ostensibly collated after the definition of its topic – ends up revealing that the topic itself is undefinable and inexhaustible, nothing more than the retroactive sum of all the members of the list. What erasure adds to these other forms of supplementary writing is the way it literalizes the act of negation: while the list implies a multiplicity of absent members through tropes of elision (the ellipse, the etcetera), erasure leaves the deletions as visible gaps on the page. Like symptomatic reading, erasure poetry establishes a topology of surface and depth in which the poet-as-critic unearths a latent signification within the source text by filtering out extraneous material and reconfiguring what remains. It is the implied distance between manifest text and latent content, between symptom and etiology, that gives this mode of critique its power, affording the critic a vantage outside or above the text from where its secrets can be descried.-->


### Readymade Erasure

The idea that erasure poetry is a form of exposure or discovery – in which the poet appropriates, from within another text, a readymade poem that was already there – informs the way that more recent works of erasure poetry, and *Nets* in particular, are often framed in relation to conceptual poetry. Vanessa Place and Robert Fitterman, for example, begin their manifesto-like survey of the genre, *Notes on Conceptualisms*, by invoking erasure as a limit case that drives the need for a more nuanced definition of the conceptual. Fitterman writes in the foreword:

> In the winter of 2008, at a launch for *The noulipian Analects* (C. Wertheim. and M. Viegener, eds., Les Figues Press, 2007), Vanessa Place, Anna Moschovakis, and I were engaged in a conversation about the poetics of erasure techniques. There was some question as to whether or not erasure strategies would fit under the rubric of conceptual writing. Depends on the end result, we agreed, more than the writing strategy itself: i.e., is the poet employing this technique to reach for a larger idea outside of the text, or is the poet primarily concerned with making a new poem out of the erased one with its own local meaning? Or, conversely, are both things happening, or don’t both things have to happen, or is there a ratio, a spectrum, of how much the new text relies on some kind of “thinkership” outside of the text itself? (11)

Compared to rote transcription, the most iconic technique associated with conceptual poetry, erasure offers the poet a greater degree of freedom to sculpt the text into a novel creation, “making a new poem out of the erased one with its local meaning” – a poem, that is, whose rhetorical texture and formal artifice reward close reading and whose value does not depend upon the reader’s knowledge of its generative procedure. Johnson, for example, reprints excerpts of *Radi os* within his multivolume epic [*ARC*]{.smallcaps} without calling attention to the fact that they are erasures of *Paradise Lost*: unlike *Radi os*, which includes both a foreword and an afterword framing the text in relation to Milton’s epic, the reprinted versions elide this paratext and present the erasure as an original composition to be read on its own terms. Erasure is anything but programmatic: two poets erasing the same text, or even the same poet erasing the same text, often produce wildly divergent results. Of all five editions of *A Humament*, for example, no two are alike: for each new version, Phillips traces a different path through his source text, excising words that the other editions retain, or retaining ones they excise. <!---Nor is *Nets* the only erasure of Shakespeare’s Sonnets. Compare to the other version.--> Fitterman and Place suggest that the indeterminacy inherent in erasure runs against the grain of a conceptualist aesthetic in which no authorial decisions (or only the most mechanical of decisions, such as where to place a semicolon in a transcription of a source text) are left to chance. It is chance that gives authors the freedom to erase texts in ways that lyricize or re-lyricize them as poetry – to “mak[e] a new poem out of the erased one with its own local meaning.”<!---TODO: Remove repetition. And talk more specifically about how Fitterman and Place read *Nets*.--> Is the erased text there to be read as a poem (that is, to be read at all, and read closely) or to be thought as a concept? Does the text invite a readership or a thinkership?

<!---the poem as a textual artifact takes precedence over the elided paratext that would otherwise document its relation to Milton’s original.--->

The question can be inverted: what makes erasure a constraint in the first place? For one, the poet can use no words that are not already on the page (or those she can make by partially erasing words, as Tom Phillips creates the protagonist Toge by erasing part of *together*). She cannot change the order or spacing of those words (although she can guide the reader to read clusters of words from top to bottom rather than left to right). And she cannot reorder the pages. Put simply, she cannot *add* anything. The set of all possible poems is already there: all she has to do (and all she can do) is choose one. It is this sense of potential that connects erasure to the Oulipo: just as Queneau’s *Poèmes* contains an enormous but finite number of possible sonnets, Shakespeare’s *Sonnets* contains an enormous but finite number of possible erasures. Rather than construct an elaborate machine for generating poems, erasure assumes that every poem (and every text) is already such a machine, and the poet is merely its operator. Erasure differs from other kinds of constraint in placing such emphasis on the act of selection: unlike the heroic struggle for *difficulté vanqué* that drives poems like *Eunoia*, erasure is an exercise in taste and discernment. (Which is not to say that erasure is easy or that its success is assured. The illusion of having extracted a poem wholesale from another page of text comes at the cost of many hours spent hair-splitting: the weighing up of one word or phrase against another, the careful balancing of space so that the poem both delights the reader’s eye and guides it fluidly across the page). It is in this sense, Place and Fitterman suggest, that erasure resembles the signature gesture of conceptualism, the art of plucking a readymade from a sea of existing text:

> Note the similarities between Kenneth Goldsmith’s appropriation triptych – *Traffic*, *The Weather*, and *Sports* – and Jen Bervin’s *Nets*, a book of poems that perform erasure on Shakespeare’s sonnets. Goldsmith adds the artist/author to the readymade quotidian, upping its art-quotient; Bervin subtracts the master from his masterpiece, author from authority. (30-1)

If erasure is an act of exposure that reveals the supplemental logic at the heart of the original (and thereby deconstructs its originality), it does so, according to Fitterman and Place, by revealing that the original is already a copy, a readymade – waiting to be reframed as an aesthetic object. The effect is amplified when the text being erased is itself aesthetic, even canonical: Bervin performs a Duchampian operation on the Sonnets by subtracting the words of their author (and therefore “the master from his masterpiece, author from authority”) while at same time asserting her own mastery over the poem, her own authorship, by appropriating and signing the Sonnets as her own.

<!---TODO: Bervin doesn’t agree. She doesn’t even agree with the term erasure.--->
<!---TODO: Find Marjorie Perloff quote about authority. Authorship.-->
<!---TODO: Add footnotes or body text on de Kooning. From Cooper. And conceptualism and erasure sheet in Ulysses.-->

But this is a reading that Bervin pushes back against. In a 2017 interview for *Asymptote*, she challenges the way in which *Nets* is often read as an example of conceptual poetry, precluding a reading of the work on its own terms:

> With *Nets*, if you are so minded, you could be dismissive of the idea of the book – a palimpsest of Shakespeare’s sonnets – but when you actually read it, that’s harder to do; it becomes moving and strange. Nets is often framed in conversations around conceptual writing, which is one aspect of it, certainly, but there are many aspects of those poems that diverge from it. I strongly prefer having the complexity of the work there to create a conversation, rather than responding to a particular critique of doing work that is relational.

Framing *Nets* as purely conceptual threatens to reduce the text to a soundbite – “a palimpsest of Shakespeare’s sonnets” – while foreclosing sustained attention to “the complexity of the work” itself. To read the book as a “readymade quotidian,” as Fitterman and Place do, is to suggest that the gesture of appropriation, rather than the texture of the appropriated text, constitutes the proper object of critical reflection. Bervin challenges this ethos by inviting close reading – not only of her erasure, but also of the dialogue it opens up with its source text, which persists underneath and alongside her revision. Rather than seeking to appropriate Shakespeare (or “subtract the master from his masterpiece”), she pushes readers to think about the loss inherent in erasure:

> I empathize with omission and the omitted. It’s one of the reasons why I don’t feel so great about the term erasure, because I’m trying to draw attention to loss, not create it.

This empathy for the omitted runs against the grain of the erasure genre, where the act of erasure (like the act of appropriating the text to be erased) typically constitutes a tactic of estrangement, serving to *détourne* an archaic or canonical text that centuries of rereading and interpretation have rendered blandly familiar. Following Bervin’s invitation to read *Nets* for the Sonnets she erases as much as for the gesture of erasure itself, I will argue that the text pushes back both against its reception among conceptual writers as a readymade appropriation of Shakespeare and against the prevailing notion of erasure as a practice of discovering a hidden origin within a manifest source. Bervin eschews the topology that is implicit in both of these models: rather than seek to find, unearth, or distill a readymade poem from beneath the surface of another, *Nets* calls attention to the way that loss and erasure already permeate the language of the Sonnets, approaching the text as a collaborator, or an assemblage of collaborators, rather than an adversary or predecessor whose legacy must be appropriated, profaned, and thereby overcome.


### Being Many

Bergvall’s “Via,” I have argued, unravels the *agon* of succession by flattening all of the Dante variations into a list without chronology – a list that also includes the original and puts its originality in question. *Nets* yields a similar effect by retaining Shakespeare’s text beneath and alongside her own (not *before*, as in a facing-page translation, where the original, printed on the *verso*, comes first). If anything, the order is reversed: printed in boldface, Bervin’s version is the foreground, the focal point, poised to capture the reader’s attention and shape her reading of the poem as a whole. Shakespeare’s version, by contrast, seems to fade into the background: although both texts occupy the same plane of the page (and even the same text block) – neither is technically in front of the other – the contrast between bold and halftone type evokes surface and depth, figure and ground. The erased text surrounds each poem like a marginal commentary, as if Bervin wrote the bold versions first and later filled in the whitespace with annotations – whose weight, fainter than graphite, makes them seem ephemeral, erasable. The original appears to come *after* its variant, a supplement that completes each poem and, at the same time, frames it as a fragment, a sample. Fragmentary and elusive, Bervin’s poems call out for elucidation, a call that Shakespeare’s words – now an afterthought, a postface – appear to answer.[^broqua-halftone]

*Nets* opens with a palimpsest of Sonnet 2 that modestly reflects upon the project as a whole:

<!---TODO: Make unbolded text grayscale.-->
<div class="nets">
> | When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
> | And dig deep trenches in thy beauty’s field,
> | Thy youth’s proud livery, so gazed on now,
> | Will be **a** tattered **weed**, **of small worth** held:
> | Then being **asked** where all thy beauty lies,
> | Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
> | To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,
> | Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
> | How much more praise deserved thy beauty’s use,
> | If thou couldst answer, ‘This fair child of mine
> | Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,’
> | Proving his beauty by succession thine.
> | This were **to be new made** when thou art old,
> | And see thy blood warm when thou feel’st it cold.
</div>

Despite its distant echo of the Poundian injunction to make it new, the poem abjures the *agon* that such remaking implies. Unlike Pound, who imagines an active (read: virile) poet who acts upon passive material with transitive force, an act of will that reforges the past and *makes* the dead speak (whether they want to or not),[^colebrook-pound] Bervin frames her remaking in the passive voice: the Sonnets invite revision, they *ask* to be new made. At the same time, she erases Shakespeare’s comparison – one of the overarching polemics of the Sonnets as a whole – between poetic making and reproductive life: addressing a young man whose beauty is fated to fade, the poem promises to commemorate (and thereby immortalize) his beauty and, at the same time, incites him to bear a child through whom his image will live on (to “prov[e] his beauty by succession thine” [12]). To be remade is to not just to reproduce, but to *be* reproduced – to be written, copied, read, and rewritten, an iterative process that is – although Shakespeare’s text attempts to evade this conclusion – prone to error and deviation. The passive construction – “to be new made” – underscores this analogy between inscription and reproduction, between the mechanical and the organic: life, in the Sonnets, is an endless cycle of rewriting and reprinting, a lineage of copies, a genealogy of images.[^more-life] By framing her remaking of Shakespeare as an invitation rather than a transgression, erasing all mention of genealogy and shifting the referent of *made* from child to poem (amplifying the vehicle of Shakespeare’s metaphor while eliding its tenor), Bervin at once challenges the notion of writing as an anxiety of influence and suspends the reproductive logic on which this notion relies: that of the poem as a child through whom the beloved – his memory, his image, and his “warm blood” – will live on.[^broqua-bloom]

Sonnet 8 performs an even more radical erasure of this genealogical metaphor:

<div class="nets">
> | Music to hear, why hear’st thou music sadly?
> | Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy;
> | Why lov’st thou that which thou receiv’st not gladly,
> | Or else receiv’st with pleasure thine annoy?
> | If the true concord of well-tunèd sounds.
> | By unions married, do offend thine ear,
> | They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
> | **In singleness the parts** that thou shouldst bear.
> | Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
> | **Strike**s each in each by mutual ordering;
> | Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,
> | Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing;
> | Whose **speechless song, being many, seeming one**,
> | Sings this to thee: ‘Thou single wilt prove none.’
</div>

The original sonnet turns upon a conceit between melody and marriage: the triad of “sire, and child, and happy mother” (with an allusion to the Holy Family and the Christian promise of eternal life) is a harmony of notes sounding in unison – the strings of a lute that, tuned to the same frequency, vibrate sympathetically without being plucked. The sonnet ends on a cautionary note: if the bachelor refuses to marry and bear children – who extend the duet of marriage into a choir of successors (a multitude that seems to form one line, one melody) – his solo performance will fade, and he will die alone (“Thou single will prove none”).[^single-none] As if fulfilling this morbid prediction, Bervin erases the young man whom Shakespeare addresses – as well as the tenor of the musical conceit that urges him to marry. Without this frame, the conceit refers instead to the poem itself, whose parts – three fragmentary lines, separated by whitespace – strike in unison, a singularity composed of multiple parts. The poem is a “speechless song” not just in the banal sense that all lyric poetry courts analogy with music (a song, even by Shakespeare’s time, played to the tune of the printing press rather than that of the lyre), but also because erasure composes a new song out of the Sonnets by rendering Shakespeare selectively mute. Together, the remaining lines and the stricken text form another pair of strings that vibrate in unison: the erasure describes not just its own parts but also the relation between source and revision, between Shakespeare and Bervin, between a world that knows only “well-tunèd” music and one that is no stranger to dissonance.[^radios-music] *Strike* becomes more forceful in this context: not just to pluck a string or strike a bell, but to excise text from a record, to flag redactions with a strikethrough font, and – more radically – to refuse to work (another form of union that joins many into one). Bervin’s *désœuvrement* of Sonnet 8 strikes out its reproductive logic – its conceit of harmony as family and melody as succession – for a more capacious notion of the *many* as a multitude, a form of being-in-common that *seems* one without eliding the difference, the *singleness*, that makes each part unique. *Being many* amplifies Bervin’s remark in the postface that poetry is inherently multiple, that every poem carries vestiges of anonymous others:

> I stripped Shakespeare’s sonnets bare to the “nets” to make the space of the poems open, porous, possible – a divergent elsewhere. When we write poems, the history of poetry is with us, pre-inscribed, in the white of the page; when we read or write poems, we do it with or against this palimpsest.

Bervin reverses the normative relation between singularity and multiplicity: the point is not that marriage makes one of many (or many of two) – that two individuals, joined in matrimony, become the font of a lineage – but rather that one is *already* many, that every singular text is inherently multiple because it permits (or even invites) a countless assemblage of possible readings and rewritings. As with “Via,” where the divergent paths of Dante translations reveal a self-difference at work in the original Italian (which the poem presents as one of its own variations), Bervin implies that her erasure of the Sonnets could be one of many, that another poet, or indeed herself, could find a myriad of different poems hidden within the same text. *Nets* reimagines the Sonnets as one node in a network rather than an origin from which all others derive, a community of poets and multiplicity of poems that erasure reveals to be, in the words of the postface, “open, porous, possible – a divergent elsewhere.” She abjures the teleology of reproduction (both poetic and organic) for the relationality of the palimpsest. She does not rewrite Shakespeare so much as write over (and therefore with and through) a text that lives on through its own erasure.

In this sense, *palimpsest* is both a metaphor for intertextuality writ large – “all that sets the text in a relationship, whether obvious or concealed, with other texts,” as Gérard Genette asserts in his magisterial study of the subject (*Palimpsests* 1) – and a physical affordance of inscriptive media, which can literally be erased and overwritten (although the line between the literal and the figurative – given that the palimpset-as-metaphor almost always appears in writing – proves difficult if not impossible to enforce). Bervin contends that all texts are palimpsests, that all writing is relational: erasure merely brings to the surface the net of interwoven links that makes a canon more than the sum of its archives. It is because the Sonnets are ductile enough to morph and adapt to their future readers – poets and critics alike (who in turn carve their own paths among their myriad figures and forms) – that they survive, altered, if not by Bervin’s eraser, then by the shifting contexts and shifting paradigms in and through which they continue to be read.


### Erasable Media

The palimpsest, however, is more than just a metaphor for erasure. Like other early modern writers, Shakespeare used a more palpable kind of erasable medium, one that informs the complex interplay between memory, inscription, and loss in the Sonnets. A descendent of the wax tablet of antiquity (no longer in widespread use after the rise of paper notebooks), the erasable tablets used in early modern England consisted of pasteboard coated with a mixture of gesso and glue, making a surface from which ink, graphite, or silverpoint – with the help of a sponge or a wet fingertip – could easily be erased (Stallybrass 388). Erasable notebooks were used to record information that writers could edit and abridge before copying it into the more durable (and more expensive) medium of the codex. In a remarkably erudite article on the role that such notebooks play in *Hamlet*, four experts on the history of the book – Peter Stallybrass, Roger Chartier, John Franklin Mowery, and Heather Wolfe – argue that the erasable tablet also serves as a metaphor for human memory, where the ability to remember presupposes (and converges with) the ability to forget. In the final scene of Act [I]{.smallcaps}, for example, when the ghost of the murdered king commands his son to vouchsafe his memory – “Adieu, adieu, Hamlet. Remember me” (1.5.91) – the prince responds by vowing to erase all other thoughts from his mind, as if from an erasable tablet:

> | Remember thee?
> | Yea, from the table of memory
> | I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records,
> | All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
> | That youth and observation copied there,
> | And thy commandment all alone shall live
> | Within the book and volume of my brain
> | Unmixed with baser matter. (1.5.97-105)

The passage opposes two models of memory – the ephemeral palimpsest and the durable codex – in an effort to make the latter seem both more transcendent (“[u]nmixed with baser matter”) and more solid, like a book, or better, like a stone tablet inscribed with a biblical “commandment,” mediating between the material and the sacred. If the “table of memory” is full of juvenilia that can be trivially copied and erased, the “book and volume” of Hamlet’s brain is by contrast an indelible medium that will preserve the ghost’s command from corruption and decay. The very suggestion that memory is erasable, however, also implies that this singular thought might in turn be overwritten, as the authors of the article suggest in their reading of the play: after Act [III]{.smallcaps}, the ghost no longer appears onstage – and it is the jester Yorick, not King Hamlet, whose death the prince goes on to commemorate. The book of the brain proves as vulnerable and ephemeral as the erasable surface it promises to supplant: if Hamlet, at a whim, can excise the trivia of his youth, nothing prevents his father’s memory from fading away in turn. Erasable tables “work only because they make writing *impermanent*” (Stallybrass 415): they are “memorial prostheses” that paradoxically “memorialize the ability to forget” (Stallybrass 413). Both as a metaphor for human memory and as a medium of literary inscription, the palimpsest is able to encode information only by presupposing its loss. It is only because memory can be rewritten *over* that it can written (or read) at all:

> Such a supplement suggests the difficulty of making any complete separation between remembering and forgetting. A technology of memory, the tables are also a technology of erasure. (Stallybrass 417)

<!---TODO: Make this a new paragraph.--->
A fitting analogy for Hamlet’s melancholy – a compulsive mourning that, unlike grief, seeks to preserve the lost object by rehearsing the impossibility of its return – the palimpsest also embodies the commemorative economy of the Sonnets, which promise to keep the memory of the beloved alive by endlessly lamenting his mortality. In a coda to their reading of *Hamlet*, the authors offer a reading of Sonnet 122, which turns around the figure of the erasable notebook and its double valence of remembrance and oblivion. Here is Bervin’s version:

<div class=nets>
> | Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
> | Full charactered with lasting memory,
> | Which shall above that idle rank remain
> | **Beyond all date**, even to eternity –
> | Or at the least, so long as brain and heart
> | Have faculty by nature to subsist;
> | Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
> | Of thee, thy record never can be missed.
> | That poor retention could not so much hold,
> | Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
> | Therefore to give them from me was I **bold**
> | To trust those tables that receive thee more.
> | To keep an adjunct to remember thee
> | Were to import forgetfulness in me.
</div>

The sonnet meditates upon a gift that the poet has received from his beloved – an erasable table – and muses that, although memories inscribed on this physical medium will fade, the memory of the beloved inscribed in his own brain will not. Echoing Hamlet’s fraught attempt to distinguish between durable and erasable forms of memory, the poet is forced to concede that human memory is only as permanent as the mortal body it inhabits: “Till each [brain and heart] to razed oblivion yield his part / Of thee, thy record never can be missed.” The poem concludes by dismissing the need for “an adjunct to remember thee”: a supplement that vouchsafes the memory of the beloved by reducing him to a fragment that also threatens, as the next line observes, to “import forgetfulness,” to rely upon a medium that is inherently prone to decay – an idea that has already been undercut by the image of human memory as itself a form of inscription, a writing on the body: “Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain / Full charactered with lasting memory.” In the end, Stallybrass and his co-authors argue, the poem fails to allay the fear that memory might be as supplemental, as prosthetic, and ultimately as erasable as the adjunct medium it purports to replace. Bervin retains this ambivalence in her erasure: on the one hand, *bold* self-reflexively invokes the boldface that marks the words she preserves, which promise to live “[b]eyond all date,” emboldened and revived with each new printing (where the boldface evokes a text that has been printed over itself, the letters thickened by multiple copies superimposed on the same page); on other hand, the paratactic structure of the poem, eliding both the subject (who or what is bold, if not the bolded words?) and the implied copulative between this absent subject and its predicate (simply *bold*, not I *am* bold or my words *are* bold), calls attention to the erasure of any persons or bodies whom this bold text might commemorate. The poem has neither subject nor being, only an unmoored sense of *boldness* – a mark of mechanical reinscription – that testifies to the way that memory survives “[b]eyond all date” only by printing over (and thereby erasing or obscuring) another text that lies beneath it. Shakespeare’s words, like the erasable tablet they describe, remain as “an adjunct to remember thee,” a supplement, printed in halftone (the typographic opposite of boldface, a font that has not been printed *enough*, as if the ink in the printer cartridge were running dry), that bears witness to its own disappearance. Remembrance persists not because the human brain, in contrast to inscriptive media, is capable of “lasting memory,” but because the poem as palimpsest can be erased and written over, iterated and altered with each new printing, so that what remains, emblazoned in bold, is only a trace of the fading letters it overwrites.

<!---A palimpsest is always many, always multiple: because it can be written over again and again, and each writing bears traces of the last.-->


### Loss & Loss

Other poems in *Nets* tie this notion of the inherent erasability of inscriptive media – the notion that writing presupposes the possibility of its own loss – to the more overtly elegiac or melancholic sense of loss that animates the Sonnets, striving as they do to defer the inevitability of old age and death through the medium of lyric commemoration. Consider Sonnet 64, for example, a poem that seems to presage, from the vantage of Elizabethan London, the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center:

<div class="nets">
> | When **I have seen** by Time’s fell hand defaced
> | The rich proud cost of outworn buried age,
> | When sometime lofty **towers** I see **down-razed**,
> | And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
> | When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
> | Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
> | And the firm soil win of the wat’ry main,
> | Increasing store with **loss** and **loss** with store;
> | When I have seen such interchange of state,
> | Or state itself confounded to decay,
> | Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate––
> | That Time will come and take my love away.
> | This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
> | But weep to have that which it fears to lose.
</div>

Through its chiastic play between *loss* and *store*, Shakespeare’s text compares the youthful beauty of the beloved to a hoard of riches whose abundance, appearing to vouchsafe its future, makes it all the more vulnerable to decay.[^chun-store] Bervin elides the tenor of this metaphor, erasing the beloved altogether, and elevates its vehicle, the down-razed towers, to an image of a singular catastrophe, an event too traumatic to justify comparison with any form of loss other than itself. By removing the *and* between *loss* and *loss*, Bervin makes the doubled word *loss* into an image of the twin towers – or rather the twin voids they leave in the Manhattan skyline. Like Kenneth Goldsmith’s *The Day* – a transcription of the *New York Times* edition published the morning of 9/11, which contains uncanny premonitions of the catastrophe that, at the time of printing, had yet to strike[^goldsmith-the-day] – Bervin unearths, buried in the rubble of Shakespeare’s verse, a lament for events that will not unfold for another four centuries. The emphasis falls less on the razing of the towers, however, and more on the duplication of loss – a sort of *fort da* game that seeks to revive what is lost by repeating the word that marks its absence. The deletion of *and* removes *loss* from any form of relation: one experiences loss only through repetition, never through conjunction – only through the disjunct, the cut, of parataxis. That cut extends from the spatial to the temporal: the poem disrupts chronological time by projecting loss into the past, a past that precedes not only the loss itself but also the construction of its object.

<!---TODO: Quote remark from editor. Loss *increases* store.-->
The original line – “Increasing store with loss and loss with store” – forms a chiasmus in which *store* increases (rather than diminishes) the potential for loss: the more you have, the more you have to lose. The sonnet goes on to suggest, however, that this loss is reversible – not by amassing more of the same, but by entrusting the memory of the beloved to a medium more suited to its preservation: poetry – and the minds of its living readers – abjures loss by re-inscribing the lost object in memory (and, through grief, the memory of its loss) – a medium that outlives any manmade structure, any tower that time or fortune will inevitably raze to the ground. Bervin erases this bittersweet consolation, trading *store* for *loss*, memory for melancholy. She short-circuits what Jahan Ramazani calls the “compensatory economy” of elegy (71) – one moment grieving the dead, the next announcing that the dead live on – by erasing both the solace of commemoration and the promise of resurrection. What lives on is loss itself, or the twin words *loss*, the remainders of an erasure that they alone survive to document.

*Nets* transforms the Sonnets’ praise for the power of poetry to immortalize the beloved (by figuring reproductive life as a form of endless reinscription) into an elegy for the possibility of enduring memory and for the lyric voice that performs the labor of commemoration. Where the Sonnets play upon an opposition between the threat of loss (a double threat: of dying in obscurity and of dying without children) and the promise of immortality – and of a medium durable enough to let one live on indefinitely – *Nets* lops off the second half of this dialectic and leaves nothing but loss (or twin *losses*) in its wake.[^sestet-octet] It is easy to read this emphasis on loss as a reflexive comment on the act of erasure (and therefore as a veiled origin, an uncanny prediction of the erasure procedure itself). But loss also resonates in these poems with a melancholia that compulsively refuses to give up its object – because that object can only be preserved by means of a constant re-inscription.
<!---TODO: Emphasize the connection here between the enduring ephemeral and the commemorative economy of elegy – both of which are melancholic. They preserve an object by endlessly re-inscribing its loss.-->

<!---TODO: Transition. It’s also about the lyric.-->

In elegy, as David Shaw keenly observes, the poet’s own death is always at stake. And because death is an experience that delimits – and so is excluded from – life (the Epicurian paradox: “when death comes, we no longer are”), elegies that intimate the death of the self inevitably invoke the ineffable: unable to imagine (and therefore mourn) their own death, poets instead lament the impossibility of mourning. This paradox also animates Bervin’s palimpsest of Sonnet 63, where the manifold senses of erasure at play in the book (of life, of memory, and of media) converge:

<div class="nets">
> | Against my love shall be as **I am** now
> | With Time’s injurious hand crushed and o’er worn;
> | When hours have drained his blood and filled his brow
> | With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
> | Hath travelled on to age’s steepy night,
> | And all those beauties whereof now he’s king
> | Are **vanishing or vanished** out of sight,
> | Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
> | For such a time do I now fortify
> | Against confounding age’s cruel knife,
> | That he shall never cut from memory
> | My sweet love’s beauty, though my lover’s life;
> | His beauty shall **in these black lines** be seen,
> | And they shall live, and he in them still green.
</div>

Like many of the sonnets that precede it, Shakespeare’s text laments the fact that the youth’s beauty will fade until he is as old and withered as the poet himself (when “my love shall be as I am now / with Time’s injurious hand crushed and o’er worn”) and promises, in the sestet, to redeem this loss by reviving him (or rather his “beauty”), “which shall in these black lines be seen, / And they shall live, and he in them still green.” Bervin erases everything in the sonnet that contributes to this redemptive promise: she turns a love poem into an elegy (or reveals that it already was an elegy), but also makes the mourning reflexive: unmoored from any object that might give it purpose, from the commemorative economy between lover and beloved, the bereaved and the grievable, the lyric *I* mourns only itself. But whose self? Is Shakespeare speaking here, lamenting the way in which his words, among the “black lines” of Bervin’s palimpsest, have faded into a halftone ink that appears to vanishing – if not already vanished – from the surface of the page? Or is it Bervin who, by suspending her ability to write in her own lyric voice, to add any words of her own, vanishes into Shakespeare’s text? The *or* between *vanishing* and *vanished* renders this question undecidable: there is no anterior moment when Bervin will have finished her erasure of Shakespeare, when the bard will have vanished without a trace and Bervin, having signed the book in her name, will have succeeded, as Place and Fitterman claim, in “subtract[ing] the master from his masterpiece, author from authority.” The conceptualist gesture of appropriating a readymade text implies a temporality of succession not unlike the *agon* of influence: to subtract Shakespeare (the most authorial of authors) from his own work is to appropriate his authority and become an author in his place, a literary version of Duchamp’s proposal to use a Rembrandt painting as an ironing board (Fitterman and Place 31). Bervin deviates from this logic – in which the act of appropriation re-inscribes the very authority it appears to subvert – by making her *I* and Shakespeare’s *I* impossible to disentangle. The poem opens a set of recursive frames: Shakespeare immortalizes the vanishing beauty of the beloved, Bervin immortalizes the vanishing *I* of Shakespeare, and the reader, in turn, gives new life to both by reading the two texts against one another – a gesture that future readers may endlessly repeat. The lyric *I*, like the palimpsest itself, is multiple, divergent – the subject of “speechless song,” as Sonnet 8 has it, “being many, seeming one.” In this way, the poem brings the paradox that Shaw discerns in elegy – where the lyric *I* cannot mourn itself, is divided from itself – into dialogue with theories of new media as a palimpsest that makes the ephemeral endure. The lyric *I* lives on by suspending itself between the process of vanishing – the condition of a palimpsest that can always be erased and given new life – and the finality of death, which the conjunctive *or* indefinitely postpones. The poem forecloses any reading that separates the living author from the dead, successor from predecessor, the black lines from the halftone traces of the text they only partially occlude. By leaving Shakespeare’s text as a trace beneath her own, *Nets* invites readers to let Bervin’s version vanish from their minds and forge their own path through the Sonnets, to make what they already were: “open, porous, possible.”

<!---But she also does so by calling attention to erasure as a *medium*. Vanishing. Black lines. The boldface.-->

<!--And here’s where *Nets* pushes back against conceptualism. She doesn’t subtract the author from authorship, the master from the masterpiece – a structure that leaves the lyric I intact while erasing the person whose experience that I is imagined to express – (*I* erased Shakespeare, I am the author ... I signed the book). This structure implies a temporality: the conceptualist who appropriates Shakespeare and signs her own name to the Sonnets come *after* Shakespeare, in his wake, and in a sense – a very Bloomian sense – kills him. Usurps him. Conceptualism is still enmeshed in the *agon* of succession. Perhaps more so than any other movement. But Bervin rather imagines erasure a process of continual vanishing and re-inscription, where there is no *after*, no endpoint or vantage from which she can look back at the Sonnets and make them hers, because they are already re-inscriptive, they are stuck in a melancholic loop, keeping Shakespeare alive by mourning his loss.-->

<!---What this poem does – I want to argue – is bring together the paradox (or tension or whatever) inherent in inscriptive media whereby memory is preserved by means of an erasure ++you need to establish this earlier in the argument++ erasability is a condition of memory ++that’s an argument that needs to precede this poem++ and the commemorative economy of the elegy (especially of self-elegy) where the self can be preserved *through* lamenting the impossibility of its preservation ++and also – in a more compensatory or redemptive form of elegy – brought back to life … In Bervin’s case – this logic is subverted: there is no binary of grievable(or lost)/bereaved, living/dead, before/after, victim/survivor, mourned/mourner, etc. in which the one who *comes* after is burdened with the power to keep the dead alive in his/her imagination. That’s not the economy at work in *Nets* – because, by making this analogy between inscriptive media and elegiac commemoration – the dead are *always* being brought back to life, they’re always dead *and* alive, *vanishing* *and* vanished (the or being a boolean *or*, a conjoint set / not a binary *or*: THIS *or* THAT – exclusive): they alive in/sa/through being dead.-->

<!---MARK: Footnotes-->

[^single-none]: As Colin Burrow notes in his edition of *The Complete Sonnets and Poems*, the final line paraphrases a proverb derived from Aristotle’s *Metaphysics*, giving the musical conceit a mathematical resonance (music being one the four arts of the scholastic *quadrivium*: the study of number and time). One is not a number, according to Aristotle, because one is a unit and a number is a multitude of units: the two are distinct substances (396).

[^radios-music]: Bervin is not alone in forging an analogy between erasure and music. Johnson compares *Radi os* to the Baroque Variations of Lucas Foss, who creates new compositions from old classics by selectively muting notes. In words that could also describe *Nets*, Johnson cites Foss on his rendition of Handel’s Concerto Grosso, Op. 6, No. 12.:

    > Groups of instruments play the Larghetto but keep submerging into inaudibility (rather than pausing). Handel’s notes are always present but often inaudible. The inaudible moments leave holes in Handel’s music (I composed the holes). (ix)

<!---TODO: Add an anchor for this footnote somewhere.-->
[^sestet-octet]: The Shakespearean sonnet inscribes this paradox in its very form: the sestet resolves the crux posed by the octet – that death is inevitable – by presenting poetry as the medium that will let the beloved live forever: the poem promises continuity at precisely the moment that it ends.
<!---Also see Roubaud re: the sonnet as a fragment.-->

[^blake-method]: Although Blake gives no explicit descriptions of his method, the engraver John Thomas Smith, in an 1828 account, describes the former’s technique of “writing his poetry and drawing his marginal subjects of embellishments in outline upon the copper-plate with an impervious liquid, and then eating the plain parts or lights away with aquafortis considerably below them, so that the outlines were left in stereotype.” (ctd. in Essick 85)

[^blake-illustrations]: Blake also produced water-colors and drawings for *Paradise Lost*, *Paradise Regained*, *Comus*, “L’Allegro,” and “Il Penseroso” (McCaffery 125).

[^Dworkin-nets]: In his preface to an excerpt from *Nets* in *Against Expression*, Dworkin observes the many facets of this polysemic title:

    > Each page of *Nets* (Brooklyn, N.Y.: Ugly Duckling Presse, 2004) manifests its procedure: a freely lyrical writing-through of one of Shakespeare’s sonnets, boldly liberating certain words from the grid of the Elizabethan sonnet and foregrounding them to establish new grammatical connections. As an example of what Leon Roudiez would call the paragrammatic – discovering “networks not accessible through conventional reading habits” – Jen Bervin nets (“to make a network”) the words she captures from her source. The trim, smart, elegant (i.e., “net”) poems that result are themselves net (what “remains after all necessary deductions have been made”): net linguistics in the same sense as net profits. Moreover, the washing clean (“to net”) of the original text replicates the washing rub of the ancient palimpsest. (110)

<!--Words like *grid*, *network*, and *profits* all serve to situate the work at the juncture of turn-of-the-millenium techno-capitalism – and therefore at home among the other procedurally-driven texts collected in the anthology.-->

[^goldsmith-the-day]: Two poems from *The Day* appear in a 2009 issue of *Poetry* magazine, together with a note describing the still unpublished project:

    > Kenneth Goldsmith is perhaps best known for his work *Day*, in which he transcribed every word of a mundane day’s issue of the *New York Times* into a nine-hundred-page book. For his work “The Day,” he did the same exact task to the *New York Times* of September 11, 2001. Hence, even the innocuous news reports and weather are loaded with fact, fear, and emotion, making us aware that language is never simply an innocent carrier of meaning but is wildly variable depending upon context and framing.

[^more-life]: In “More Life: Shakespeare’s Sonnet Machines,” Julian Yates argues that the analogy between life and inscription in the Sonnets, which seems calculated to vivify poetry and to champion the sonnet as a form capable of sustaining life, a form in which life might survive itself, ends up backfiring: it is life that comes to resemble a mode of inscription, rather than inscription a form of life. In the end, he writes, “the sonnets assume the status of a machine, a calculable program of routines” – a machine in which “you, the reader, are the bios being written, the life being produced” (339).

[^broqua-bloom]: Comparing three contemporary rewritings of Sonnet 130, including the one in *Nets*, Vincent Broqua invokes Harold Bloom’s reading of Shakespeare in the preface to the second edition of *The Anxiety of Influence*, arguing that these texts use formal procedures in order “to diverge from a theory which posits – like Bloom’s and its avatars – that literature is a tragedy originating in Shakespeare’s *essential* and *universal* grandeur” (7). Bervin’s poem in particular suggests that “the texts of the past are no longer valuable because they stand in and for the past, but they happen and coexist simultaneously in and with our reading” (40). If *Nets* subverts the notion of the canonical text as a tragic origin, I would add more modestly, that is because they call attention to the way in which the Sonnets already put pressure on the metaphor of writing as a form of inheritance or succession.

[^broqua-halftone]: Broqua makes a similar point in his brief reading of Sonnet 130, arguing that the oscillation between halftone and bolded print injects an element of alterity into the poem, calling its self-identity and originality into question:

    > Whereas in a quotation, one borrows from a prior text, one cuts one’s material from an older text and leaves the rest of the old text behind, here the new text seems to appear as a quotation within the older material, which the reader can apprehend fully. The layout of the old and the new texts seems to suggest that the new highlighted text in bold type is a foreign body in the density of the older text. While the new text is being traced over the surface of the older text, it doesn’t rub it out. The new text becomes a synecdoche of the old one as well as its tangible ghost. This is once again a new literalisation of intertextuality: the eerie phenomenon of a to-and-fro movement between Shakespeare’s and the new text experienced with the two other poems commented on above is made apparent on the page itself of Bervin’s minimal production. So much so that it is almost impossible for the eyes to focus and adjust between grey and bold, thus creating a perpetual ongoing reading whose echoes are almost already traced. A spectral phenomenon ensues: it is hard to know which text comes first and one wonders if there is one text at all. (37-8)

[^colebrook-pound]: For a critique of Pound’s poetics of renewal as a form of reproductive futurity, see Colebrook, “Queer Aesthetics.”  Colebrook argues that these poetics are “[s]exually normative” to the degree that Pound “aligned artistic experimentation with a fertile, productive, and living expenditure that would produce ends that were not already determined” (35). The notion of poetic homage as an act of living creation, she goes on to suggest, acquires a sovereign logic in *The Cantos*, resonating with Pound’s vocal support for Italian fascism: “[B]y emphasizing art as a decisive break with the circulation and system of production for the sake of a higher, productive, and creative end beyond already justified life, Pound justified a violence of the present for the sake of a future that would return life to its proper, active, and expansive creative potential” (36).

[^chun-store]: Compare Wendy Chun’s distinction between *memory* and *store* in her incisive analysis of digital memory as a form of “enduring ephemeral”:

    > Crucially, memory is an active process, not static. A memory must be held in order to keep it from moving or fading. Memory does not equal storage. While memory looks backward, according to the [OED]{.smallcaps}, to store is to furnish, to build stock. In computerspeak, one reverses common language because one stores something in memory. This odd reversal and the conflation of memory and storage glosses over the impermanence and volatility of computer memory. Without this volatility, however, there would be no memory. Memory stems from the same Sanskrit root for martyr, perhaps comparable to the ancient Greek term for “baneful,” “fastidious.” Memory is an act of commemoration – a process of recollecting or remembering. (164)

    What makes new media *new*, Chun goes on to argue, is less their superhuman speed or power than their reliance upon physical media – cathode tubes, mercury lines, and even flash storage – that constantly erase and rewrite the information they promise to retain. If digital media seem both less solid and more durable than analog media (a paradox embodied by the figure of the cloud – at once ephemeral and transcendent), that is because they elide the cycles of decay and renewal, the constant flicker of electrical charges, that make digital information both highly volatile and seemingly inert. The fantasy of digital memory as an impregnable archive follows from a conflation of regenerative memory with static memory, or, more simply, of memory with storage. By arguing that artificial memory depends upon a process of constant erasure and re-inscription (and describing this process as an act of remembrance), Chun builds upon theories of the palimpsest in which all inscriptive media, not only digital memory but also the erasable tablets of Shakespeare’s era, exhibit a melancholic compulsion to commemorate a lost text by repeatedly overwriting it. Chun observes:

    > If computer memory is like anything, it is like erasable writing; but, if a penciled word can be erased because graphite is soft, a computer’s memory can be rewritten because its surface constantly fades. (160-1)
