# Sublime Data: Georges Perec and the Vertigo of Lists

In his 1982 essay “Penser/Classer,” the last piece he wrote before his death, Georges Perec offers the following reflection on the art of writing lists:

> There are two contradictory temptations in any act of enumeration: the first is to cover [everything]{.smallcaps}, the second is to leave something out all the same; the first temptation would seek to close the question forever, the second would leave it open; between the exhaustive and the incomplete, enumeration seems to me to be, prior to any sort of thought (and prior to any thought of sorting), the intrinsic mark of our need to name and to collect without which the world (“life”) would be unmappable. (131)

A list that strives for completeness must also confront all the miscellaneous things that it cannot account for. The “unmappable” and the “incomplete” signify a negation that is also a surplus, disrupting the list from within and gesturing toward the world without, a world that is too capacious and too chaotic to be subsumed under an abstract rubric. If enumeration gives rise to “ineffable joys,” that is because the list conceals an abundance that cannot be collected or named, even if “our need to name and to collect” carries the force of an obligation.

The word *enumeration* itself exemplifies this problem. Derived from medieval rhetoric and negative theology, the trope of *enumeratio* involves composing a deliberately incoherent list in order to evoke the unnameable attributes of God. From the sixteenth century onwards, as Christopher Johnson observes, *enumeratio* begins to register a waning belief in the power of analogy to structure our knowledge of the world. The redundancies and digressions of the list serve less to instruct and delight than to dramatize its own failure to achieve closure:

> [W]hen enumeration, as is increasingly the case in the late Renaissance, becomes more disjunctive than conjunctive, when the semantic elements it enlists are divergent or lack a stable conceptual frame, the impression is created that the world’s many parts and attributes are fragmented, discontinuous, that the writer’s perception of these parts is chaotic, aporetic, or that the *division* or analysis necessary for abstract thought, deductive certainty, is impossible. (1106)

Johnson goes on to argue, however, that the impossibility of summing up the world itself becomes a powerful theme of enumeration, reflecting upon the loss of the ordered cosmos is once served to praise. The list registers “that language (*verba*) has failed to furnish that definitive, supplementary part [which would make the list complete], and that this failure is now itself the subject, the matter (*res*) at hand” (1098). In this sense, the excessive *copia* of enumeration acquires a generative force, a force that is both redundant (from the Latin *redundare*, to surge again) and abundant (*abundare*, to overflow): “Rhetorical enumeration is redundant in the original sense of the word: it provides the necessary, material abundance out of which new thinking might emerge” (1111). The abundance of the list, capable of inciting new forms of thought through redundancy and supplementation, is closely tied to its paratactic structure, its omission of conjunctions or other connective tissue that would ossify its elements into a taxonomic order. Johnson draws upon Theodore Adorno’s argument that parataxis, in the poetry of Friedrich Hölderlin, produces “artificial disturbances that evade the logical hierarchy of a subordinating system” (131): enumeration, for Johnson, is paratactic in its tendency “to spurn the epistemological comforts of axioms and concepts, preferring instead to linger in the material precincts of language, where multiplicity and contingency can be best experienced, catalogued, and often given metonymic order” (1098). Although he leaves open the question of whether enumeration constitutes a properly transhistorical genre, Johnson mentions the “experiments of the [OULIPO]{.smallcaps}” as one of the many “verse and prose forms that enumerate conjunctively, disjunctively, paratactically, hypotactically, mechanically, or haphazardly,” gesturing towards a more capacious entanglement between Oulipian constraints and the enumerative tradition that my own reading of Perec will explore in more depth (1105).

<!---[^johnson-llull]: (for example, in their fascination with the *ars combinatoria* of Rámon Llull)--->

Beyond its use as a rhetorical trope, enumeration is etymologically related to number: to enumerate is also to count. The [OED]{.smallcaps} offers four definitions:

> 1. The action of ascertaining the number of something; *esp.* the taking a census of population; a census.
> 2. a. The action of specifying seriatim, as in a list or catalogue.
> 3. b. *concrete.* A catalogue, list.
> 4. *Rhetoric* transl. Latin *enumeratio*: A recapitulation, in the peroration, of the heads of an argument.
> (“enumeration”)

In many programming languages – a domain not covered by the [OED]{.smallcaps} entry – *enumeration* also denotes a method of assigning related names to a set of integer values and, less commonly, as a function that loops through a data collection by returning each of its members as an index-value pair [^1]. All of these definitions share an emphasis on the inherently serial, iterative, and quantitative character of enumeration, requiring its operator (whether human or machine) to collect, tally, epitomize, or otherwise reduce an assortment of items to a linear series or finite sum. This sense of enumeration as a mode of counting stretches back to the rhetorical origins of the word: as Johnson observes, Renaissance poets and rhetoricians frequently draw comparisons between metrical verse and empirical measurement, two complimentary ways of comprehending the world by number. With this analogy in mind, he asks what happens to rhetorical enumeration when all fields of knowledge, not only mathematics, are increasingly understood in quantitative terms: “[H]ow does enumeration, not of numbers, but of words and things function in an epoch when quantification comes to dominate the emerging episteme?” (1105) Although the epoch in question is the late Renaissance and the Baroque, Johnson’s query resonates far beyond those periods – as his allusions to Hölderlin, Beckett, and the Oulipo suggest – and speaks with particular urgency to a digital milieu in which the distinction between the enumeration of numbers and the enumeration of things can no longer be taken for granted. In *Digital Memory and the Archive*, Wolfgang Ernst takes up this connection between list-making and computation in a chapter on the intertwined etymologies of the German words for telling and counting (*zählen und erzählen*): “Between the cultural practices of telling and counting, one finds both an affinity and a disjunction; narration and the numerical code can be seen as functions of alternating conditions of the media. The numerical order, the basis of digital technologies, has always already been performed as a cultural practice before becoming technically materialized.” [-@ernst13, 147]. Like other verbs that bridge the numeric and the rhetorical – such as *connote* (whose original connotation, Ernst observes, is both “telling” and “mathematical counting in discrete leaps” [148]) or the minimal pair of *count* and *recount* (or the French *compter* and *conter*) – the verb *erzählen* encodes a historical connection between the literal and the numeric: “To tell, we learn, as a transitive verb, means not only ‘to give a live account in speech or writing of events or facts’ (that is, to tell a story) but also to count things’ (to tell a rosary, for example). The very nature of digital operations and telling thus coincide” [-@ernst13, 147-8]. Cognate with *zählen* (and Old English *talu*), the English *tell* is no less polysemic: one can tell a story, but also tell one thing from another (“the very nature of binary calculations,” as Ernst observes [148]), or, with John Keats, feel the numbness of “the Beadsman’s fingers, while he told / His rosary” (5-6). <!---Enumeration binds many of these-->

<!---This chapter is certainly not the first to remark upon Perec’s use of enumeration.---> 

These two exigencies of enumeration – the exhaustive and the incomplete, order and disorder – also animate the relatively sparse body of criticism on Perecquian lists. In an essay for a 2004 special issue of Yale French Studies (fittingly entitled “Pereckonings”), Bernard Magné explores Perec’s use of the index as a form of “peretext,” a concept that (with a nod to Gérard Genette, although *Paratext* itself makes no mention of indices) gives this otherwise supplemental genre “a role that goes well beyond its usual functions in order to make it into one of the text’s major constituents, a place of scriptural maneuvers that contribute to the construction of meaning” (72). Through his readings of the indices to *Quel petit vélo* and *La Vie mode d’emploi*, Magné shows how the index, arguably the most banal and innocuous of genres, is riddled with hidden puzzles and oblique constraints that belie its merely indexical function:

> Far from offering a convenient tool for understanding the story, the Perecquian index constitutes above all an opaque space, largely enigmatic, transforming the reader into a specialist of hermeneutics. It is not a means to locate, it is an invitation to search. Perhaps we should take this list for what it undoubtedly is, a type of enumerative poem whose signifiers are finally less important than its radical strangeness. (76)

On the one hand, Magné suggests, the index aims to exhaust its object, to reduce each of these novels to to a finite set of topics and to assign each topic a page number that points unambiguously to the corresponding passage. Such anchors or locators, as they are sometimes called, promise to deliver the reader swiftly to any topic she desires, and lend the index the sense of authority typically reserved for more empirical forms of tabular data. On the other hand, errors are inevitable: whether by authorial design or editorial blunder, the index to *La Vie mode d’emploi* occasionally confounds the reader with page numbers that lead nowhere, or at least not to the topic they index. Most striking among these misdirections is that of Perec’s own name: the Livre de Poche edition of the novel omits the author from the copyright page (the only place, in the Hacette-[POL]{.smallcaps} edition, where the proper noun *Perec* appears) without updating the corresponding entry in the index, leaving a dead link that points, in turn, to the absence of the author. Such detours, Magné argues, transform the page numbers of the index into “markers that lead the reader astray into a space mined by the undecideable” (87). Undecideable because, if even such a reliable apparatus as the index proves fallible, how can the reader decide what part of the text constitutes the fiction proper, and what part makes up its paratext? The resemblance between lists printed inside the novel and those printed as appendices makes it impossible to tell where the novel itself begins and ends, to delimit the text from its constitutive outside.

By suggesting that the Perecquian index constitutes “a type of enumerative poem,” Magné implies that the tension inherent in this genre – one that aims to supplement, organize, and explain, but ends up revealing “a radical strangeness” at the heart of the text – might also operate within the more explicitly literary forms of enumeration that Perec explores in his writing. In *Constraining Chance*, an incisive and capacious monograph on Perec, Alison James takes up this question (which Magné’s brief and avowedly schematic essay leaves undecided) as part of her larger argument that Perec explores contingency and error in his work as a way of tempering the determinacy inherent in Oulipian forms. Resisting the temptation to read Perec’s lists of things as a merely “sociological” critique of consumerist experience, she argues that “[a]lthough the openness of enumeration threatens the stability of the characters’ worldview, it can be also be seen in positive terms as an acknowledgement of the infinite multiplicity of the real” (212). For James, the failure of the list to exhaustively capture its object is one way that Perec mediates between the Oulipian project of eliminating chance through programmatic constraints and a realist desire to register the complexity and contingency of lived experience:

> Perec’s own classifications – whether of cars, umbrellas, reading habits, or eyeglasses – might seem to be symptomatic of a “utopian” obsession with producing order and excluding chance. However, Perec’s texts also undermine the notion of classification, suggesting that no ordering principle can ever completely account for the real – or rather, that too many organizing principles can be found or invented, none of which can be privileged. Perec’s lists thus suggest the existence of a disorder more radical than the disorder of incompletion. (222)

It is because the world itself is fundamentally disordered, James suggests, that even the most exhaustive list cannot hope to capture it. She reads the list as one form in which chaos and order, chance and constraint, collide: “Understood in this context, the anti-chance of Oulipian constraints is only apparently at odds with Perec’s fascination with the randomness of the infraordinary: constraints both incorporate and resist disorder, while acknolwedging that all order may be founded on chance – or vice versa” (224). James offers a compelling account of Perecquian enumeration that situates his otherwise eclectic use of lists within the context of his broader fascination with contingency, challenging the assumption (propagated by Oulipians as well as by their critics) that constraints, conceived as deterministic rules, serve only to insulate writing from the eventfulness of the world. On the contrary, James argues, the constraint implicit in enumeration – that an exhaustive list will organize its contents into a coherent system – ultimately founders when confronted with the multiplicity of the world it seeks to contain, because “no ordering principle can ever completely account for the real.”

In what follows, I build upon this persuasive account (which focuses on Perec’s most canonical works of fiction and accordingly draws primarily upon realist theories of description) by reading some of his more experimental and poetic lists alongside his critical reflections on list-making in “Penser/Classer.” Perec’s observation that enumeration mediates between the exhaustive and the incomplete, between the quantitative rigor of the list and its inconclusive form, resonates, I argue, with debates in media studies and the digital humanities around the question of how literature written for the page might engage with (and to some extent resist) our increasingly digitized culture.


### The Database Sublime

In a special issue of [*PMLA*]{.smallcaps} on the database as a literary genre, Edward Folsom invokes *Leaves of Grass* as a pre-digital example of information overload:

> Anyone who has read one of Whitman’s cascading catalogs knows this: they always indicate an endless database, suggest a process that could continue for a lifetime, hint at the massiveness of the database that comprises our sights and hearings and touches, each of which could be entered as a separate line of the poem. [-@folsom07, 1572]

Folsom goes on to suggest that such a “database does not handle completion well – it is voracious and thrives on revision, addition, and supplementation.” Other contributors to the special issue echo this language of the endless and the incomplete. Meredith McGill observes that the database “holds out the promise of completeness” and yet also embodies “the open-endedness of the digital medium itself, a quality that points toward a utopian future in which archival scholarship is bound not by financial or physical constraints but by the imaginations of its creators and users” [-@mcgill07, 1592]. Jerome McGann contrasts the power of the database “to draw sharp, disambiguated distinctions” with the literary text that is “necessarily n-dimensional, protean, shifting,” but adds that “works like poems and novels are already marked data ... multiply coded” [-@mcgann07 1589-1].

Perhaps the most compelling response is from Katherine Hayles, who challenges Folsom’s assertion (following Lev Manovich) that database and narrative are “natural enemies.” On the contrary, she argues, they are “natural symbionts,” casting narrative (and the literary more broadly) as an elusive figure that the database depends upon but is unable to capture or exhaust. On the one hand, databases are “self-describing artifacts” governed by “formal properties of closure”: they must articulate their values explicitly and unambiguously in order to reliably store information. On the other, narratives “gesture toward the inexplicable, the unspeakable, the ineffable,” supplementing the rigor of data with “the unknown hovering beyond the brink of what can be classified or enumerated” [-@hayles07, 1605]. Hayles associates this “unknown” with the inherent polyvalence of literary texts and their potential to afford a nearly endless array of possible readings. The ineffable here is not so much a specific mode of aesthetic experience, a moment when language strives to represent the supersensible by confessing the impossibility of doing so, than the concept of the literary as a disturbance *within* the formal logic of the database. Narrative and interpretation endure in the new millennium because they are supple enough to engage with forms that defy representation, not only forms that cannot be quantified as numeric data but also the unrepresentable excess of the database itself.

This tension between the ineffable and the digital echoes a broader concern among media theorists with what Alan Liu (after Julian Stallabrass) calls the “data sublime” [-@liu08 p. 228]. Liu draws upon both Kantian and Lyotardian conceptions of the sublime in order to describe the surfeit of information produced by postindustrial (and especially digital) culture, a surfeit that is too vast to be captured in a single image and yet which for just that reason has inspired countless attempts to depict it. Invoking Lyotard’s definition of the postmodern sublime as what “puts forward the unpresentable in presentation itself,” Liu extends this definition to include the way that new media work to dissolve both “the substrate of a work and the bodily practices of the artisanal artist,” so that the unrepresentable or “transcendental” character of disembodied data becomes the general condition of aesthetic practice in the digital age [-@liu08 p. 235].

If data are unrepresentable, however, it is not just because they lack a proper medium, but also because the very concept of data denotes something that cannot be grasped by the senses. The word derives from a Latin participle meaning literally “the things having been given,” a sense preserved by the French term *les données*. As Alexander Galloway observes, a datum is not simply a fact or measurement but rather a “natural gift” or “empirical trace” that is “not so much thrown into the world, but left over, bare, remaining after the tide of being recedes” [-@galloway12, 81]. For this reason, data as such are unrepresentable: they have no pre-given form and must be shaped into information in order to become perceptible. Information is a process as much as a product: “the act of taking form or putting into form” [-@galloway12, 81]. Since data are fundamentally mathematical values that lack any inherent or self-evident relation to the objects they measure, any representation of data reveals more about the procedure used to generate the representation than about the data itself. Visualizing data requires “a contingent leap from the mode of the mathematical to the mode of the visual,” a leap made possible by artificial rules for converting abstract numbers into legible signs. For this reason, Galloway argues, every data visualization is “first and foremost a visualization of the conversation rules themselves, and only secondarily a visualization of the raw data” [-@galloway12, 83].

Galloway goes on to argue that the unrepresentability of data and its tendency to generate uniform images feeds into what Friedrich Kittler would call “convergence”: the way in which new media appear to erase distinctions among media and medium-specific forms and genres by encoding diverse media (images, audio, film, text) as an undifferentiated stream of numeric data. Galloway puts the matter rather bluntly:

> What are the aesthetic repercussions of these claims? One answer is that no poetics is possible in this uniform space. There is little differentiation at the level of formal analysis ... One can not talk about genre distinctions in this space, one can not talk about high culture versus low culture in this space, one can not talk about folk vernacular, nor about modernist spurs and other such tendencies. [-@galloway12, 85]

For Galloway, to align the unrepresentable with “aesthetic information,” whose purpose is no longer to educate or communicate but to stultify observers with the vertigo of massively complex systems, is to nullify its power to estrange. If the mathematical sublime belittles our imagination by presenting a phenomenon so vast that we cannot apprehend it as a unified image, he argues that the graphs he cites do the opposite, reducing the unrepresentable surplus of the web to an infographic we can easily download and digest: “*[E]very map of the Internet looks the same*. Every visualization of the social graph looks the same. A word cloud equals a flow chart equals a map of the Internet. All operate within a single uniform set of aesthetic codes. The size of this aesthetic space is one” (85). Despite the axiomatic character of this claim (underscored by logical terms such as *every*, *all*, *set*, and *equals*), Galloway goes on to suggest more modestly that representations of enormous datasets all end up looking the same because they rely upon routine algorithms and generic protocols that reveal more about the process used to generate a given image than the data from which it derives. In this view, images of data overload are not properly sublime at all: although their network graphs and particle clouds might dazzle viewers with their complexity, the forms they take are predetermined, and bear no signs of the sublime attempt, always destined to founder, to register traces of the unrepresentable, to give insensible data a perceptible form.

Galloway goes too far, however, in arguing that new media as such – not only visualizations of the web – banalize and homogenize aesthetic representation to the point where “no poetics is possible in this uniform space” (85). Citing the same passage, Patrick Jagoda observes that this claim “resembles the common critique (really, the truism) that realist representation fails to totally capture its object” [-@jagoda16, 21]. He goes on to argue that collections of data (specifically networks) take many diverse forms that invite close reading and medium-specific analysis (as well as receptiveness to analogies across media). The unrepresentable remains an integral concept for understanding new media and one that is irreducible to its use in network graphs that aestheticize data into a static image. Liu anticipates this position in his analysis of the data sublime: artists who strive to depict the nebulousness of disembodied information, to mediate demediation itself in the form of an image, are still constrained by the affordances of the media in which they work. One striking example is W. M. Turner’s *Light and Color (Goethe’s Theory)*, a painting of Moses writing the Pentateuch that figures the overflow of the divine word as a vortex of radiant light – or what Liu calls “a romantic prefiguration of the data pour”:

> Out of this data pour emerges what seems to be the first record of a transcendental database: an image of Moses writing the Pentateuch. Yet what necessary quantum of aesthetic experience, we may ask, is added by Turner’s distinctively formal and material signatures – his rough yet limpid handling of oils and his very imposition of the vortex form? (229)

Liu leaves this question open, turning swiftly from Turner to a series of contemporary artworks that more explicitly address the theme of “data transcendence” (239). This romantic example, however, fortifies Liu’s broader argument that art can only give form to formless information through and against the resistance inherent in its specific medium, which registers in turn, however obliquely, the signature style of an embodied artist. It is through the layered opacity of oil paint that Turner both obscures any perspectival lines that would yield an illusion of spatial depth and, at the same time, whorls the pastel colors of the image into a vortex that seems to emanate from, and revolve around, the solitary figure of Moses writing at its center. Shaped by and through the unique affordances of oil paint (and the “formal and material signatures” that it invites and permits), this painting differs radically from the cliché maps of the internet that Galloway cites as examples of the banality of new media. Liu argues, on the contrary, that attempts to represent the formlessness of data are rarely formless or homogenous in and of themselves, but rather emerge from (and give form to) “material embodiment – in the substrate of a work and the bodily practices of the artisanal artist both” (234-5). If aesthetic embodiment appears endangered or besieged in post-industrial culture, it endures, Liu argues, through the material practices of artists who register traces of what he calls the “ethos of the unknown,” the ethos “of the unencoded, unstructured, unmanaged – in human experience” (236). It is through heightened attentiveness to specific media and specific forms – and not by embracing their demediation – that, “[i]n our current age of knowledge work and total information,” an “experience of the structurally unknowable can still be conveyed in the structured media of knowledge” (236).

### Thoughts of Sorts

How can the unknown endure in a quantified world? This is also the question posed by Perec in “Penser/Classer.” Much as Whitman’s epic catalogues offer literary scholars such as Folsom and Hayles a way to theorize the database through the lens of genre theory, Perec’s reflections on enumeration shed new light on this debate by drawing rich analogies between language and computation, even though (or perhaps because) those analogies rarely move beyond the hypothetical. Like media theorists and digital humanists who query the uncertain future of literature in the new millennium, Perec turns to the figure of the unrepresentable as a way of tracing the intertwined fates of literary expression and quantitative data. If the joys of enumeration are indeed “ineffable,” that is partly because enumeration is inseparable from the numeric, and numbers have the potential to reach unthinkable sums. The question then becomes: is thinking also a sort of counting, a type of sorting? In Perec’s own gloss, the forward slash between *penser* and *classer* implies that the relation between thinking and sorting cannot itself be sorted out (an ambiguity ingeniously preserved by David Bellos’s translation, “Thoughts of Sorts”). Must one think before one sorts? Or is sorting (images, words, thoughts) a prerequisite for thinking? To think is itself to sort intuited objects under general concepts, to encapsulate and abstract. But what separates this sort of abstraction from more programmatic or procedural methods of organizing information? Is there a sort of thinking that is irreducible to the output of a thinking machine?[^thinking-machine]

One answer is that there are sorts of thoughts that cannot be sorted, and perhaps even ones that cannot be thought. Much as enumeration spans the abyss of the “unmappable” and the “incomplete,” thinking must inevitably confront the “unthinkable”:

> It is as if the question prompted by the title, “Thoughts of Sorts / Sorts of Thoughts,” questioned thinking and sorting in such a way as to make “thinking” unthinkable except in splinters, in dispersion, forever returning to the fragmentation it was supposed to try to put in order. (120)

The unthinkable embodies many of those values that Hayles associates with narrative and the literary: it is fragmentary, polyvalent, resistant to being classified under fixed categories or abstract concepts, and for that reason never merely exemplary. But rather than oppose the dispersive force of the unthinkable to the inflexible logic of taxonomy, Perec figures the unthinkable as a fold *within* the thinkable and the sortable.[^2] The sentence unravels like a möbius strip whose two sides share a continuous plane: the question of how to sort thoughts reveals thinking itself to be unthinkable (i.e. unclassifiable under the rubric of a determining concept) and, at the same time, implies that the unthinkable precedes and conditions the logical orders that try to assimilate it. Like Perec’s concept of the “infra-ordinary,” an imperceptible fabric that dwells in the interstices of lived experience, the unsortable is thoroughly intertwined with the systems that we use to map and comprehend the world, even as it threatens their coherence.[^3] This is perhaps why Perec calls thinking unthinkable “except in splinters, in dispersion” (in the French: “s’émiettant, se dispersant,” literally what splits and disperses itself [150]): the attempt to systematize thought reveals the degree to which thought is already splintered and contradictory. Perec recounts how the essay emerged from an assemblage of disparate jottings:

> What hove into my mind’s eye were things all fuzzy and wavering, fleeting and unfinished, and in the end I decided to retain the perplexed and uncertain character of these shapeless scraps, to stop short of pretending to organize them into anything that might have a claim to the appearance (and the charm) of an article with a beginning, a middle, and an end. (120)

Constructed as a cluster of splintered thoughts, the essay performs its own argument that beneath the semblance of enumerative order lurks a fundamental disorder, or, as Perec puts it, “that thinking refers ultimately to the unthinking underneath it, and that’s what’s really filed away in well-sorted files, what they serve to mask, ferociously, is the unsortable, the unnameable, and the unsayable...” (121).

The essay itself is an unsortable collection of lists culled from diverse sources: grammar manuals and dictionaries (including a section on interjectives from “a rather poor crossword dictionary”), the Universal Decimal Classification, a catalogue of the 1900 Paris Exhibition, Sei Shônagan’s eleventh-century *Pillow Book*, Borges’s Chinese Encyclopedia, and novels by Jules Verne, Raymond Queneau, Harry Matthews, and Italo Calvino. A single letter marks each section of the essay but the order of the letters is not alphabetical, a system that Perec critiques (in Section L: “The Alphabet”) for “superimposing a hierarchy onto a sequence that is inert by definition” (126). Instead the sections take their order from the first sentence in Calvino’s *If On A Winter’s Night A Traveller* and, like the stories in that book, they could be reordered at random without making the text any less readable. Perec describes his process as “a matter of *montage*” – an apt metaphor both because he splices together disparate chunks of text (“notes scrawled on pads or loose sheets”) and because the disjunctive structure produced by this method allows the examples to form their own series of “fortuitous encounters” (136). An essay about sorting that is nothing but unsorted fragments: the text exemplifies its own argument that literary enumeration, despite its ambition of forming a cohesive image of the world, ultimately dissolves into parataxis.

For Perec, one of the most perplexing examples of such “taxonomic vertigo” is the Dewey Decimal System. The [dds]{.smallcaps} is a universal method for classifying books, encoding their primary topic as a three-digit arabic numeral and specifying subtopics with a series of fractional decimals. This system replaces an older library model that assigns books a fixed location in the stacks, usually following their order of acquisition. By contrast, the [dds]{.smallcaps} gives each book a relative index and corresponding relative location that ties it to a stable yet flexible category. What makes such a system vertiginous is not just its dizzying scale but also its systematic reduction of things to numbers: a library is no longer a collection of objects but an array of indices that bear no resemblance to the things they index:

> By what sequence of miracles was it ever agreed, more or less all over the world, that
>
> > 668.184.2.099  
> 
> refers to toilet soap (finishing processes), and
>
> > 629.1.018-465  
> 
> refers to ambulance sirens, whereas
>
> > 621.3.027.23  
> > 621.436:384  
> > 616.24-002.5-084  
> > 796.54  
> > 913.15  
> 
> refer respectively to electrical tension under fifty volts, foreign trade in diesel engines, prophylactics for tuberculosis, camping, and the historical geography of China and Japan! (127)

Here vertigo is a matter of style as much as of quantity. Perec heightens our sense of bewilderment by translating this array of numbers into a catalogue of disconnected topics. Jumps in syntax are also jumps in scale: the apposition between the list of numbers and the list of things underscores the power of numeric abstraction to shrink-wrap objects of any size into a portable fraction. Although the first half of the sentence is conjunctive, joining examples with *and*, the examples quickly multiply to form disjunctive lists: the third example reads like an index to a library catalogue, and the final clause, glossing this example, forms a list that, with the exception of its final *and*, is largely asyndetic, omitting conjunctions among its disparate elements.[^johnson-asyndeton] To some extent, this is a side-effect of the syntactic rules governing the production of lists in English and French, where conjunctions are reserved for the final pair of items. In this context, however, the otherwise normative syntax of the list appears oddly disjunctive – both because it follows and comments upon an unintelligible block quote (which, although grammatical in the context of the sentence, nevertheless blockades and interrupts the flow of reading) and because the elements of the list itself are radically incongruous. Linked only by non-sequiturs, they belie the promise, implicit in any list, that its members relate, if not directly to each other, than to some overarching category that justifies their inclusion and, by the same token, eliminates the need to use conjunctions (or other forms of connective tissue) to bind them all together. In contrast, Perec’s list more closely resembles the random-access database it annotates: first used in [IBM]{.smallcaps}’s Fortran language in 1972, the comma-separated list is a common format for storing tabular data and is still widely used (with the official extension .csv, or “comma-separated value”) in library databases today. It also appears in numerous programming languages as the default syntax for defining an array or a set, as in Swift: “An array literal is written as a list of values, separated by commas, surrounded by a pair of square brackets.” (The items listed above, for example, can be expressed with the following literal: “["electrical tension under fifty volts", "foreign trade in diesel engines", "prophylactics for tuberculosis", "camping", "the historical geography of China and Japan"]” – a code snippet that, despite the brackets and quotation marks, is not significantly more telegraphic than Perec’s own.) Whether composed for machine compilers or for human readers, the comma-separated list has the effect of abruptly suturing its elements together without explicitly subordinating them to a governing concept. Part of a broader strategy of parataxis in the essay (including the disruptive use of block quotes in the passage above), the list forges an analogy between the rhetorical art of enumeration – with its propensity to generate incongruent lists – and the indexical art of sorting: both express the vertigo of data by removing the connectives that would otherwise shape that data into an intelligible form.

[^johnson-asyndeton]: Johnson argues that asyndeton plays a significant role in Renaissance enumeration, citing an extreme example from Quirinus Kuhlmann’s 1671 *Libes-Küße*, “a sonnet in which enumerating parataxis becomes pure asyndeton, as it consists principally of a succession of nouns or adjectives with barely any conjunctions or grammatical complications” (1133). Johnson goes on to argue that this asyndetic structure allows the parts of the sonnet to be read or recombined in almost any order, forming “an inexhaustible combinatory machine” (1133) or “poetic machine” (1135). Although he does not mention Raymond Queneau at this point, whose *Cent mille milliards de poèmes* is just such a machine for generating sonnets by recombining a set of interchangeable lines, Johnson mentions the “experiments of the [OULIPO]{.smallcaps}” as one of the many “verse and prose forms that enumerate conjunctively, disjunctively, paratactically, hypotactically, mechanically, or haphazardly” – and, in a footnote, gestures towards a connection between Italo Calvino’s fascination with combinatorics and the *ars combinatoria* of Rámon Llull (1105).

This vertigo of the index finds another rhetorical counterpart in the *etcetera*, a word that innocently conceals the unsorted surfeit that every list is compelled to exclude. Perec cautions against the abstraction of the etcetera even as he concedes its necessity:

> nothing seems simpler than making a list, but in fact it’s much more complicated than it seems: you always leave something out, you’re tempted to write etc., but the whole point of an inventory is not to write etc. (14)

The etcetera guards against infinity while also conjuring up a hoard of unlisted things that remain barely concealed, waiting to spring into view. It is a sort of carte blanche, assuring the reader that, given sufficient time and space, the list would be complete. Confessing upfront to exclusions that can then be dismissed as negligible or irrelevant is an effective way to preempt our suspicion that something crucial has been omitted: the etcetera suggests that the elided information is accessible somewhere else, if only there were an interface capacious enough to represent it. Many of Perec’s lists call attention to this elision. Consider, for example, a list of categories of animals that Perec claims to have culled from bureaucratic records (a response, he notes, to Borges’s infamous taxonomy of impossible animals in “The Analytical Language of John Wilkins”):

> A\) animals on which bets are laid, B) animals which may not be hunted between 1 April and 15 September, C) beached whales, D) animals subject to quarantine on entry into France, E) animals in joint ownership, F) stuffed animals, G) et cetera*, H) animals which are carriers of leprosy, I) blind dogs, J) animals to which large estates have been bequeathed, K) animals which may be taken on board, L) lost dogs without collars, M) asses, N) mares thought to be gravid. (129-30)

The asterisk after “et cetera” marks a revealing footnote: “There’s nothing intrinsically odd about ‘etc.’; it’s just its position in the list that makes it seem bizarre” (129).[^4] But that is precisely the point. The list relegates its own excess – what is too numerous to count or too random to sort – to this trailing delimiter that offers a semblance of closure, assuring us that we have read everything we need to know, that there is nothing more of import to tally. Shifting the etcetera to the middle of the list destroys this semblance. It is no longer a coda but an internal limit, a fold or *point de capiton* that reveals the incompleteness and incoherence of the set it sutures together.[^james-etc]

[^james-etc]: By acknowledging that an et cetera can appear in the middle of a list, Perec also suggests that every list is inherently tentative, marked, as James observes, by an invisible et cetera:

     > Even in the most complete of Perec’s lists, the “etc.” remains implicit. Perec’s enumerations rarely claim to be exhaustive; they are merely *attempts* at exhaustivity or at drawing up inventories (“tentatives d’épuisement” or “tentatives inventaire”). (212)

    Magné discovers another et cetera in the index to the novella *Quel petit vélo*, which breaks off abruptly:
    
    > First surprise for the reader: this index breaks off inexplicably after 164 entries at the letter P, on the word “psittacism,” immediately followed by an “etc., etc., etc.” (74)


### Attempt at an Inventory

Perec’s work includes countless examples of lists that struggle with miscellaneous excess: all of the objects on his writing desk, everything he can see from a café window in central Paris, all the places has has slept. Undoubtedly the most bizarre of these experiments is his Rabelaisian catalogue of everything he ate and drank for a year. The title is itself a mouthful: “Attempt at an Inventory of the Liquid and Solid Foodstuffs Ingurgitated by Me in the Course of the Year Nineteen Hundred and Seventy-Four.” An analog forerunner of the now almost ubiquitous practice of posting realtime images of meals to Instagram and Twitter, the inventory is one of Perec’s many attempts to trace the infra-ordinary, the sensible fabric and granular texture of everyday life. In contrast to other texts in *L’infraordinaire* that deviate freely from the task of describing the everyday, “Inventory” is remarkably strict, comprising nothing but a list of food and drink loosely grouped by category. Imagine ten pages of paragraphs like this one:

> Two Guéméné andouilles, one jellied andouillette, one Italian charcuterie, one cervelas sausage, four assorted charcuteries, one coppa, three pork platters, one figatelli, one foie gras, one fromage de tête, one boar’s head, five Parma hams, eight pâtés, one duck pâté, one pâté de foie with truffles, one pâté en croûte, one pâté grand-mére, one thrush pâté, six pâtés des Landes, four brawns, one foie gras mousse, one pig’s trotters, seven rillettes, one salami, two saucissons, one hot saucisson, one duck terrine, one chicken liver terrine. (244)

More interesting than *what* Perec ingurgitates (read: gargantuan portions of meat, cheese, and cake, and over a hundred bottles of wine and spirits) is how he tries to sort this gastronomic data into meaningful categories. Should a salad with crab and Roquefort be filed under salads, seafood, or cheese? (For Perec the answer almost always seems to be cheese. Yogurt, too, is apparently a kind of cheese.) Do fruity sweets count as fruit? Yes, especially if you only eat one piece of fresh fruit a year and need to bolster your Vitamin C intake with such healthy alternatives as “one pêce de vigne in syrup, one peaches in Sancerre, one bananas flambées.” And what does it mean to eat *one* peaches or *one* bananas? Perec often uses the singular article to describe plural nouns (“one stuffed dates”), presumably because stuffed dates or bananas flambées count as a a single dish, albeit a dish whose size is left speciously ambiguous. He also mixes the general and the specific in ways that undermine the authority of his tally: how can one eat “five rabbits” *and* “two rabbits en gibelotte, one rabbit with noodles, one rabbit à la crème, three rabbits à la moutarde, one rabbit chausser, one rabbit à l’estragon, one rabbit à la tourangelle, three rabbits with plums”? Such redundancies dispel the illusion of rigor promised by the title. The inventory serves less as a culinary portrait than as a critical reflection upon its own enumerative method.[^perec-food-scholarship]
<!---TODO: Add reference to Dworkin’s preface in *Against Expression in the sentence above.-->

The gap here between descriptive rigor and Perec’s reluctant confessions (or calculated omissions) recalls a similar passage in *Life A User’s Manual*, his encyclopedic novel about the tenants of a Parisian apartment block and the complex ways in which their lives intertwine. The novel abounds with lists, often in the form of block quotations, that disrupt the already digressive narrative even as they tell stories of their own, revealing subtle details about otherwise circumspect characters through the things they choose to inventory and preserve.[^perec-life-lists] One such enumerative portrait introduces the minor character of Beatrice Breidal, the elder of two teenage sisters who live with their grandmother, Madame de Beaumont, in a large flat on the second floor. In a parody of her namesake Beatrice Portinari, Dante’s abstraction for perfect feminine beauty, Breidal is “constantly preoccupied by her weight” and subjects herself to a Spartan diet that, like Perec, she records in a diary “obviously kept for this purpose alone.” Consulting her personal database, the *Complete Table of Energy Values of Customary Foods*, she draws up a list of each item together with its caloric value:

> ----                                               ----
> Tea, no sugar, no milk                             0
> One pineapple juice                                66
> One yoghurt                                        60
> 3 rye biscuits			                                 60
> Grated carrots			                                 45
> Lamb cutlets (two)	                                 192
> Courgettes                                         35
> Goat cheese, fresh			                             190
> Quinces                                            70
> Fish soup (without bread or garlic mayonnaise)     180
> Fresh sardines	                                     240
> Cress and lime salad                               66
> Saint-Nectaire                                     400
> Blueberry sorbet                                   110
> [total]{.smallcaps}                                1,714
> ----                                               ----

But if the purpose of this diary is “obvious,” an act of self-accounting legitimated by hard facts, such candor also serves to veil the countless repasts that go unmarked:

> Despite the Saint-Nectaire, this analysis would be absolutely reasonable if it did not sin grievously by omission; to be sure, Anne has scrupulously entered all she ate for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but she has taken no account at all of the forty or fifty furtive raids she made between meals on the fridge and the larder to try to calm her insatiable appetite ... In fact she is practically continuously nibbling something or other, and whilst she is now doing her self-consoling sum with her right hand, with her left hand she is gnawing a chicken leg. (203)

Raw data is an oxymoron, as Lisa Gitelman reminds us, and the data in this table is most certainly cooked. Each food is equated with its caloric value – rather than, say, its nutritional content or gustatory savor – a value that is itself abstracted from a statistical average. (Not all quinces, after all, are exactly seventy calories). But Beatrice’s palate rebels against such abstractions: her nightly binges are the consequence less of her personal foibles than of the system’s failure to account for the sensuous appeal of each food and its claim on the human appetite. The discrepancy between *rillette pâté* (600) and *tea, no sugar, no milk* (0) is one of sensible quality as well as caloric quantity, the difference between an object of desire – singular, irreplaceable, affectively charged – and a countable sum that renders any food potentially equivalent to any other.

To sin grievously by omission: we might say the same of Perec’s inventory, if the omission were not so self-consciously marked. The text includes not one but three lacunae, three etceteras, disguised under the rigor of algebraic variables: “*n* buffet froid” (102), “*[N]{.smallcaps}* café” (106), and “*n* vin divers” (106). A buffet, of course, is already an unspecified quantity of food, and *n* is the algebraic equivalent of all-you-can-eat. Stranger still are the wines: paired with the epithet *divers* (sometimes translated as “miscellaneous,” although I prefer the archaism of John Sturrock’s “*n* sundry wines,” implying something that is sundered or set apart),[^sundry] the phrase is doubly ambiguous, refusing to specify not just how many but how many of what: glasses, bottles, cases? This ambiguity contrasts starkly with the wine list that precedes it, which meticulously records both variety and vintage:
<!---TODO: Consider mentioning the fact that all three terms pair a singular noun (an uncountable mass noun in the case of *café* and *vin*, perhaps of *buffet* too) with a variable that counts integers, as in nth-degree. See the miscellany book at Russell’s.-->

[^sundry]: Sturrock uses *miscellaneous* in his translation of *Species of Spaces*, but *sundry* in a later translation published in *Granta* magazine (92).

> Nine Bordeaux, one Bordeaux Clairet, one Lamarzelle ’64, three Saint-Emilions, one Saint-Emilion ’61, seven Château-la Pelleterie ’70s, one Château-Canon ’62, five Château-Négrits, one Lalande-de-Pomerol, one Lalande-de-Pomerol ’67, one Médoc ’64, six Margaux ’62s, one Margaux ’68, one Margaux ’69, one Saint-Estèphe ’61, one Saint-Julien ’59. (248)

The two-digit year after each wine forms a sort of poetic refrain that harmonizes the list even as its achronological order breeds confusion. It is no less thorough than the ledger that keeps stock of the Altamont’s cellar in *Life A User’s Manual*: “a wine list in which every bottle is entered by geographical region, name of grower, name of supplier, vintage, date of entry, optimal maturity date, and, where relevant, date of leaving,” followed by a two-page deluge of just such oenological data (176). But Perec’s own wine list seems ill-content to be reduced to a series of abstract figures. Shifting his attention from the orderly to the sundry, he echoes the moment in *Georgics* [ii]{.smallcaps} when Virgil, after spending over two dozen lines describing nothing but vineyards, confesses that he cannot go on:

> Non ego te, Dis et mensis accepta secundis,  
> transierim, Rhodia, et tumidis, Bumaste, racemis.  
> Sed neque quam multae species nec nomina quae sint,  
> est numerus; neque enim numero conprendere refert.

Umberto Eco cites this passage in *The Infinity of Lists* as an example of “the topos of ineffability,” the reduction of “something that is immensely large, or unknown” to “a specimen, example, or indication, leaving the reader to imagine the rest” [-@eco09, 49]. The overripe grapes form a fitting analogy for the poet’s own excess, both truncated and extended *ad infinitum* by a negation. Perec amplifies the trope from the ineffable to the innumerable: not just too many to tell, but quite literally beyond count. “[*[N]{.smallcaps}*] sundry wines” gives the illusion of quantitative rigor but instead opens the floodgates to an endless binge, permitting any amount of wine to be smuggled into the list untabulated. The phrase recalls what Christopher Johnson describes as the inbuilt “redundancy” of enumeration: much as engineers add a similar or identical component to any part of a complex machine that is likely to fail (n+1), poets and novelists in the baroque and neo-baroque tradition often compose hyperbolic lists that repeat previous elements for rhetorical effect. As the redundancies grow (n+3, n+4, etc.), the encyclopedic function of the list, its power to collect, order, and ratify information, threatens to dissolve into a string of unregulated particulars.[^johnson-hyperbolic]

The joke, of course, is that Perec is too blotto after drinking these sundry wines to accurately record their labels. Ian Jack suggests that *sundry* “presumably mean[s] the stuff that just arrives slyly at the table in a carafe, or the stuff that one is too drunk to remember drinking.” The task of composing the inventory involves ingesting substances whose deleterious effects on human memory make this task impossible, a sort of self-defeating constraint. In this way, Perec stages a tension between visceral confession and clinical detachment: the fact that he is drinking these wines as he attempts to record them undermines his position as an impartial observer. This is an old quandary. In the Third *Critique*, Kant relegates the enjoyment of wine to the status of the merely “agreeable” [*angenehm*], a counterexample to the universal subjective validity of the beautiful:

> [A person] is perfectly happy if, when he says that sparkling wine from the Canaries is agreeable, someone else should improve his expression and remind him that he should say “It is agreeable to me”; and this is so not only in the case of the taste of the tongue, palate, and throat, but also in the case of that which may be agreeable to someone’s eyes and ears. [-@kant00, 97]

As with so many of his examples, Kant’s invocation of wine at the critical juncture in the text is hardly accidental. Wine is agreeable rather than beautiful not only because its enjoyment is a matter of personal taste, *merely* subjective rather than subjectively universal, but also because the senses involved in its perception (“the tongue, palate, and throat”) are more vulgar and proximal than the ears and the eyes. To judge wine means ingesting it into one’s own body, abolishing the fragile distance between subject and object proper to disinterested aesthetic reflection. And wine itself dulls and perplexes our powers of judgement, making it more agreeable the more we drink.

In a similar way, the humor behind Perec’s sundry wines lies in the gap between the aloofness implied by the catalogue form and the obvious impossibility of remaining distinct from or impartial towards the things we eat and drink. Everything listed is also ingested, making the cataloguer’s own body as much a part of the list as the foodstuffs he ingurgitates. As with Beatrice Breidel, a failure of accounting betrays an incurable habit or insatiable appetite that is indifferent to the distinction between one portion and the next, an error in description that is also a confession of unmastered desire. What Craig Dworkin and Kenneth Goldsmith call “Perec’s Rabelaisian list” unleashes a sense of *copia* no less monstrous than the one Christopher Johnson finds in *Gargantua and Pantragruel*:

> To list for Rabelais is to ludically dissolve ossified categories and concepts in the face of more vital, contingent truths. It is to give voice to the dynamic profusion of material things and words, but especially to express, the undeniable, if irrational claims of the body.” [-@johnson12, 1112]

But the confession is not without an air of calculation: Perec is suspiciously eager to confess his vices while staying circumspect about his virtues. He gobbles up a cornucopia of beef and pork but only one (unspecified) piece of fresh fruit. And besides an innumerable quantity of coffee (“*[N]{.smallcaps}* café”), the only nonalcoholic drinks can be counted on one hand: a tisane and three Vichy waters. Such glut is less a matter of what he eats than of how he collects and organizes the data: the imbalance between booze and healthy drinks, for example, might look very different if he had decided to include tap water. It is as if the capacious form of the inventory demands an equally intemperate diet, even if the author must resort to hyperbole. Roland Barthes argues that taking pleasure in food above and beyond its function of sustaining life makes gastronomy perverse, and this perversion takes the form of an elaborate sequence (from the first whiff of a new dish to its lingering aftertaste) that memory prolongs indefinitely.[^5] If the list is a genre that tends toward excess, the food list redoubles that tendency by making excess its own visceral theme.

Like other Perecquian catalogues involving his body – places where he has slept, his movements through urban space – embodiment in this context has less to do with sensory experience than with data about the body. In another essay in *Penser/Classer*, Perec describes how he staves off his fear of “losing track of myself ” by keeping a detailed log of “objective” experiences: “time of waking, timetable, journeys, purchases, progress in work (measured in lines or pages), people met or just seen, details of the evening meal I had eaten in this or that restaurant, books read, records listened to, films seen, etc” (51). If such timetables and biometrics threaten to make the body docile and governable, they also constitute a reparative practice that seeks to insulate the self from being reduced to a mere number.[^6] Perec contrasts his method of logging the infra-ordinary with more sinister forms of enumeration: the death tolls published in weekly newspapers, for example, which quantify the impact of plane crashes and hijacked airplanes by counting lives as statistical metrics rather than grievable losses. Our compulsion “to measure the historic, significant, and revelatory” obscures the sensible fabric of daily life and its power to resist totalizing systems of abstraction. Yet the infra-ordinary opposes big data not through nostalgia for the lost world of things, but by appropriating the former’s own programmatic logic. To record every nuance of modern life, a life that is composed as much of numbers as of objects or words, requires a method that is algorithmic as well as imperative: “Describe your street. Describe another street. Compare” [-@perec-species p. 210]. Such rigor is what distinguishes Perec’s peculiar form of enumeration from more capacious genres such as the epic catalogue or the encyclopedic novel. (Rabelais, for example, shows Pantagruel gobbling hordes of tripe but never deigns to give an account of exactly how *much* he eats.) A list should be exhaustive rather than merely copious: to omit details simply out of convenience is to legislate unjustly what sorts of things deserve to be remembered.

Omission is inevitable, of course, which is why Perec calls his gargantuan list a *tentative* as well as an *inventaire*. Derived from the medieval scholastics, both the English and the French forms of this word signify an experiment as well as an attempt, a provisional trial that proceeds with rigor despite the uncertainty and contingency of its result.[^7] As with the two other tentatives in Perec’s oeuvre – *Tentative de description de quelques lieux parisiens and Tentative d’epuisement d’un lieu parisien* – this attempt to capture his annual diet as a finite set runs aground on its own surfeit. Perec’s redundancies and elisions register traces of a world that is too subtle and too complex to be counted, even if, without “our need to name and collect ... the world (‘life’) would be unmappable” (131). It is these glitches, more than the system they corrupt, that makes the infra-ordinary palpable. A bottle of pinot gris left untabulated, an extra portion of duck confit – what is stake in such omissions is not Perec’s appetite but the system that records it, a system that is too riddled with error to succeed in reducing life to a statistical average or a governable sum. What is not “computationally tractable,” to borrow Willard McCarty’s phrase, can still be felt as a disturbance, however tentative, within the order of the list, a gap between our embodied sense of being-in-the-world and the abstract models that call that world to account.[^8]

[^1]:	The Swift Standard Library defines *enumerated()* as a function that “[r]eturns a sequence of pairs (n, x), where n represents a consecutive integer starting at zero, and x represents an element of the sequence.” Enumerating the first line of Perec’s “Inventory” would produce the following array: [(1, “Nine beef consommés”), (2, “one iced cucumber soup”), (3, “one mussel soup”)]. In an unrelated sense, Swift also defines enumeration as “a common type for a group of related values.”

[^2]:	Like the unrepresentable, the unthinkable and the unsortable posit a limit to conceptual thought and linguistic expression. In this context, the term could also imply a mathematical limit: according to axiomatic set theory, every set must presuppose an empty set as one of its members, a category that is routinely left implicit (sometimes marked by the symbol ø, sometimes by empty brackets) but nevertheless legitimizes the set as a finite totality by marking all the other things it excludes. Giorgio Agamben invokes this aspect of set theory in *Homo Sacer* in order to describe the sovereign logic of the *exceptio* and its power to render the border between inclusion and exclusion – or between law and extra-judicial force – indistinct (23-5).

[^3]:	Johnson describes *enumeratio* in baroque poetry in similar terms: even as the proliferation of redundant elements threatens the coherence of such rhetorical lists (and the world of which they are a microcosm), redundancy “provides the necessary, material abundance out of which new thinking might emerge” [-@johnson12 p. 1111].

[^4]:	We might compare this anomaly to the one that Foucault discovers in Borges’s original list – the category of animals “included in the present classification,” a species that includes its own genus and so forms an infinitely recursive loop:

    > [I]f all the animals divided up here can be placed without exception in one of the divisions of this list, then aren’t all the other divisions to be found in that one division too? And then again, in what space would that single, inclusive division have *its* existence? Absurdity destroys the *and* of the enumeration by making impossible the *in* where the things enumerated would be divided up. Borges adds no figure to the atlas of the impossible; nowhere does he strike the spark of poetic confrontation; he simply dispenses with the least obvious, but most compelling, of necessities; he does away with the *site*, the mute ground upon which it is possible for entities to be juxtaposed. [-@foucault02 p. xviii]

[^5]:	For Barthes, the *jouissance* of gastronomy is inseparable from the pleasure of the text. Prefacing a new edition of Brillat-Savarin, a writer who “desires the word as he desires truffles, a tuna omelette, a fish stew,” Barthes describes the language of gastronomy as “a twofield delight”: “greedy [*gourmand*] for the words it wields and for the dishes to which it refers” [-@barthes89, 261]. No less greedy, Perec’s inventory enjoys a palate that is as delectably polyglot as any modernist poem: besides French, there are words from English (*apple pie*, *haddock*, *Jack Daniel*), Italian (*figatelli*, *mozarella*), Spanish (*chivas*, *porto*), Russisan (*vatrouchka*, *slivowitz*, and of course *vodka*), Turkish (*tarama*, *yaourt*), and Arabic (*moulakhia*: curiously enough, the only italicized foreign word in the whole text). Not to mention his inclusion – on the cheese platter, wedged between *boursin* and *bree* – of “two Brillat-Savarins.”

[^6]:	Glossing Sturrock’s description of Perec’s use of constraints as a form of “willed objectivity,” David Levin Becker characterizes such a practice as “a way of foregrounding the technical in order to take enough pressure off the personal that it can express itself more or less organically” [-@becker12, 182]. In a similar vein, David Bellos associates Perecquian enumeration with “the basic human impulse to hold on to things, to fend off loss by compulsive acts of recording.”

    Not everyone would agree. The uptake of the Oulipo among conceptual writers, for example, has consistently downplayed the reparative and expressive potential of constraint-based writing. In their preface to “Attempt at an Inventory” in *Against Expression: An Anthology of Conceptual Writing*, Craig Dworkin and Kenneth Goldsmith argue that Perec’s errors and omissions undermine the ostensibly confessional nature of the list: “Slippages of accounting and excursions into the realm of fantasy move Perec’s quest more into a realm of Wittgensteinian language games that of accountability or self-definition” [-@against-expression, 477]. But this reading misses the point: if Perec sees list-making as a way to know and remember the self, it is because the descriptive process itself (and not the facts it records) registers the whims and idiosyncrasies of the one who describes. Slippages are where the list is most personal.
<!---TODO: Add reference for Bellos in the footnote above.-->

[^7]:	The tentative differs from the logic of exhaustion, which seeks to turn description into a scripted procedure that always produces the same irrefragable sum. Perec’s oeuvre is full of characters who undertake exhaustive projects that never amount to more than provisional attempts. Perhaps the most famous is Bartlebooth, aptly named after Melville’s scrivener, who spends decades of his life painting watercolors of fifty seaside ports and making them into jigsaw puzzles – only, in the end, to have them chemically erased. (*Life A User’s Manual* famously ends with Bartlebooth’s corpse slumped over a nearly finished puzzle, complete but for a single x-shaped hole, and clutches in his dead fingers the final piece which the spiteful puzzle-maker Winckler has carved into the shape of a [w]{.smallcaps}.) Like puzzle-making, the art of enumeration tarries with the tentative and the incomplete. It is a self-defeating attempt at systematic description, a form that cannot abide tentativeness and yet cannot function without it.

[^8]:	McCarty coins this phrase to describe the “complete explicitness and absolute consistency” required by digital models[-@mccarty04].

[^thinking-machine]:<!---Although this chapter explores analogues between Perecquian enumeration and new media primarily at the level of literary form, it is worth noting Perec’s engagement (more reluctant than any of the other authors in this study) with the computing technology of his time.-->Although Perec never used a computer himself, David Bellos observes that “the *concept* of a thinking machine played a significant role at a key stage in his development as a writer, and provided him with material and a model for some of his most experimental work” (38). In 1966, together with Marcel Bénabou, he invented a theoretical device that could generate literature by taking a passage as input and replacing every substantive with its dictionary definition, transforming Wordsworth’s famous line (“I wandered lonely as a cloud”) into a far more nebulous utterance (“I wandered lonely as a mass of watery vapor suspended in the upper atmosphere”) (Bellos 39). Although the machine – called [PALF]{.smallcaps} (or *production automatique de littérature française*) – was never built, Bellos cites it as “the first explicitly mechanical device entertained by Perec for the production of literary texts,” one that first attracted the attention of Raymond Queneau and led to Perec’s invitation to join the Oulipo (40). 

    Perec also came into contact with paper-based systems of information retrieval (still operated by hand, although later automated with a punchcard system) in his day job as an archivist and low-level administrator (codenamed “*technicien [III B]{.smallcaps}*”) at the Neurophysiological Research Laboratory in Paris. Bellos argues that the mechanical tasks of archiving and cataloguing – as well as his first-hand experience of government bureaucracy – inform some of his most programmatic texts. Foremost among these is a flowchart, co-authored with programmer Jacques Perriault and sponsored by the Humanities Computing Center of the French National Research Council, entitled *The Art and Craft of Approaching Your Head of Department to Submit a Request for a Raise* (42-3). In a letter to his German translator Eugen Helmlé, Perec describes this project and its algorithmic logic:

    > It consists of a certain number of propositions that can take either yes or no for an answer, each answer having certain consequences. The concatenation of causes and effects and the choice of answers are represented by arrows that are the only syntactic connectors between the propositions. In brief, it is a tree structure, a network, a labyrinth, and the “reader” chooses [ONE]{.smallcaps} route among all the possible routes, the totality of possible routes being presented [SIMULTAENOUSLY]{.smallcaps} on the flow-chart. (ctd. in Bellos 43)

    In 1968, again collaborating with Helmlé, Perec composed a short radio play for the Saarländischer Rundfunk entitled *Die Maschine*. Presented in the voice of an imaginary computer, the monologue simulates a computational analysis of Goethe’s “Wandrers Nachtlied [II]{.smallcaps}.” The machine, we are told, comprises “a number of programs that enable it to approach the poem from different directions, to grasp it in all its diverse aspects, and to execute various linguistic operations that present the poem in a new light” (ctd. in Wolff, “Oracle” 90). Bellos suggests that *Die Maschine* “is probably among the first works of any kind to bring the *idea* of humanities computing into the literary field” (42).
    
    This idea has not always met with enthusiasm. Mark Wolff, the author of several essays on the Oulipo and computation, argues that *Die Maschine* demonstrates an “almost naive optimism in the power of computation to both analyse Goethe’s poem and synthesise it within a canon of world literature” (91). Wolff finds no irony in suggesting that, “[f]or Perec, ‘the essence of poetry’ can be apprehended through sufficiently elaborate mechanical means” (92). Bellos, on the other hand, maintains that Perec dons programmatic constraints precisely in order to expose the contradictory logic of the mechanical and the calculable – an argument I develop in my own reading of Perecqian enumeration (and one that does not depend upon the biographical or philological claim that, as Wolff avers, “Perec clearly understood how computers worked” [91]). Although Wolff elsewhere tempers this position by arguing that constraints “enabl[e] Perec to separate mechanical reasoning from indeterminate exceptions in order to define the boundaries of the algorithmic and the incalculable” (91), the argument relies upon the very binary logic it attempts to subvert: to *separate* the mechanical from the exceptional, to *define* the boundaries between them, is itself a mechanical procedure that divides the world into pairs of absolutes. On the contrary, Perec’s writing bears witness to the entanglement of these categories: it is precisely through and within programmatic constraints that contingency reveals itself in the form of errors, slippages, and omissions. Although none of the lists I read in this chapter engage directly with the context of computing, they share with the texts cited above a profound sense of tension between their programmatic structure and their literary texture, one that resonates with the aporia  inherent in computational logic without reducing that resonance to a merely biographical mode of reference.
    
    For further historical accounts of Perec’s interest in (and suspicion towards) computers, see Magné, “Perec et l’ordinateur,” Wolff, “Reading Potential,” and Wilken, “The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over the Lazy Dog.”
    
[^perec-food-scholarship]: On the theme of food in Perec’s work as a whole, see Magné, “Tentative,” and Jullien. The only English-language article on the topic focuses solely on *W ou un memoire d’enfance*, making the surprising claim that “when we consider food as food in [Perec’s] work, there is very little to sink our teeth into” (Wadhera 327) – reading this absence psycho-biographically, as yet another allusion to the death of his parents. Perecquian cuisine is indeed marked by absence (such as the anonymous wines elided by the phrase “*n* vin divers” [“Inventory” 106]), but, as with all of his texts, this clinamen takes some elbow grease to discover: absence, in Perec, is never as blatant as a hunger strike or a missed meal.

<!---Constraints, for Perec, do not *separate* anything at all, but rather demonstrate the entanglement of the procedural with the contingent. Alison James puts the matter succinctly in *Constraining Chance*: -->

[^perec-life-lists]: James compares the use of enumeration in *Life A User’s Manual* to its abiding concern with the “chaotic multiplicity of the world” (214). One of the most capacious lists in the novel, that of all the objects that tenants over the years have left on the stairs, exemplifies her larger argument that behind the exhaustive order of the Perecquian inventory lurks an irrepressible contingency:

    > The grouping of the elements makes no distinction between temporal succession (“over the years”) and spatial contiguity (“on the stairs”), nor does it seem to obey any other discernable thematic or formal principle. Yet it is precisely in this apparent disorder that the meaning of the list is to be found: the bewildering series signifies the disconnectedness and heterogeneity of things and their enigmatic survival once their connection to their function in human life – and their links with other objects – have disappeared. (214)

[^johnson-hyperbolic]: As an example of a hyperbolic list that collapses “the distinction between numerical and non-numerical enumeration,” Johnson cites John Donne’s “The Computation”:

    > | For my first twenty years, since yesterday,
    > | I scarce believ’d thou could’st be gone away,
    > | For forty more, I fed on favours past,
    > | And forty’on hopes that thou would’st they might last.
    > | Tears drown’d one hundred, and sighs blew out two,
    > | A thousand, I did neither think nor do,
    > | Or not divide, all being one thought of you;
    > | Or in a thousand more, forgot that too.
    > | Yet call not this long life; but think that I
    > | Am, by being dead, immortal; can ghosts die?

    The poem, Johnson observes, “swiftly compiles ‘twenty years’ then ‘forty more’ and eventually a ‘thousand’ and then a ‘thousand more’ to hyperbolically express the sense of longing the poet has for his beloved since he saw her last, on the previous day” (1105). The rapid multiplication of this amorous count (an echo, perhaps, of Catullus 5, in which the Latin poet overwhelms Lesbia with thousands upon thousands of kisses) serves less to quantify the time that separates the lovers than to demonstrate the power of “immense numbers to astound and teach.” For a longer discussion of the relation between hyperbole and enumeration, see Johnson’s magisterial and deeply erudite study *Hyperboles: The Rhetoric of Excess in Baroque Literature and Thought*, especially 67 – 91.
