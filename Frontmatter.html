    <h1>Vita</h1>
    <p>Ian Sampson holds an English B.A. from the University of Calgary, where he studied medieval poetry and creative writing, and an English M.A. from Simon Fraser University. During his studies at Brown, he received a four-year Doctoral Fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, a Mellon Foundation Grant for co-organizing a year-long seminar on the Poetics of Research, and the Boccaccio Afterlife Award for his adaptation of a novella from the <cite>Decameron</cite>. He has taught courses on Plato, Shakespeare, and modern poetry from romanticism to the present, delivered papers at the <span class="smallcaps">ACLA</span> and the Modernist Studies Association, among other venues, and published work in <cite>The Calgary Renaissance</cite>, an anthology of experimental poetry, as well as the chapbook <cite>Mona Lisa</cite> from No Press.</p>

    <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

      <p>Every list, says Georges Perec, ends with an <em>et cetera</em>: for all its promise of inclusion, something is always left out. I therefore dedicate this page to the omitted, without whom this assemblage will always be incomplete.</p>

      <p>My thanks to the friends and mentors in Calgary who first inspired my love of poetry: Helen Hajnoczky, Ian Kinney, Derek Beaulieu, Christian Bök, etc. To all my peers at Brown for the spirited debates that fueled our seminars – and for the chance to hear my thoughts, as Lauren Berlant might say, exposed to others and to my own ineloquence. To my fellow conspirators, too numerous to name: Samir Sellami, Carlo Agostoni, Brigitte Stepanov, Carolina Tobar, Lorenzo Aldeco Leo, Dennis Johannßen, Benjamin Brandt, Seth Thorn, Eric Foster, Natalie Adler, Stephanie Galasso, Charlotte Buecheler, Edwige Crucifix, Felix Green, Katie Fitzpatrick, Steven Swarbrick, Rebecca van Laer, Jerrine Tan, John Casey, M.J. Cunniff, Claire Grandy, Antoine Traisnel, Dan Ruppel, Julian Saporiti, Björn Kühnicke, etc.</p>

      <p>My thanks to the professors who taught me the meaning of critique (from κριτική, to discern): Ellen Rooney, Zachary Sng, Susan Bernstein, Timothy Bewes, Elizabeth Weed, Joan Copjec, Karen Newman, Jacques Khalip, Gerhard Richter, etc. To Massimo Riva for encouraging my interest in Italo Calvino (and for foregoing an espresso “in solidarity”). To Lorraine Mazza and the other English Department staff, for years of guidance and advice. And to my committee – Marc Redfield, Cole Swensen, and Michelle Clayton – who read these pages with a judicious balance of scrutiny and care.</p>

      <p>My thanks to the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada for a four-year Doctoral Fellowship during my time at Brown, and a Master’s Scholarship before that. To Ray Siemens and the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab at the University of Victoria, for hosting me during the final months of this project. And to those who responded to early prototypes of these chapters: Ada Smailbegović, Geoffrey Wildanger, and the other members of a year-long seminar on the Poetics of Research, where I first presented my chapter on Georges Perec; Joel Simundich, Jessica Tabak, and Matthew Beach, among others, who workshopped my chapter on Christian Bök; and the panel Copy Writers at the 2016 <span class="smallcaps">ACLA</span>, which occasioned my chapter on Caroline Bergvall.</p>

      <p>My deepest thanks to all my family, who, in different ways and in different cities, have supported me through all my scholarly endeavors. To John and Sue, for many a glass of kefir, and for the home where I wrote more than half of these pages. (And to Neptune, their irascible cat, for never failing to remind me of his lunchtime, and mine.) To Graeme and Jhoely, for their kindness, their laughter, and their infectious sense of rhythm. To Edda and Peter, who showed me how and why to cover a <i class=foreignphrase>Kölsch</i> with a coaster (as, one summer at their home in Köln, I stumbled through my first reading of Heidegger’s <cite>Sein und Zeit</cite>). To Andreas, for kindling my love of languages, my desire to travel, and the insight that a  word (with enough <i class=foreignphrase>Gesöff</i>) can be a world unto itself. And to my mother, Suzanne, the most inspiring scholar I know, who read to me from my earliest days, fueled my passion for writing, and gave me the courage to make that passion a vocation. I owe you all more than you can know.</p>

      <p>My thanks, finally, to Dave Morris and Paper Street Theatre, for reminding me that life, for all its proprieties, is improvised. My thanks to Megan Fox, my oldest and most trusted friend. And, most of all, my thanks to Bianca Bernal, whose love I would not trade for all the tofu in the world.</p>
