# Nothing Looped: Caroline Bergvall on the Refrain

In a series of reflections on Perec’s unfinished project *Lieux*, Caroline Bergvall observes how his use of time as a constraint exposes his writing to contingency and variation, eventually leading to the project’s abandonment. Describing one of the few published excerpts from this work, “Tentative d’epuisement d’un quartier parisien,” collected in *L’infra-ordinaire* (alongside that other tentative inventory of everything he ate and drank for a year), she writes:

> A *tentative* is as tentative as an attempt. Open to the fallibility of an experiment that ties writing to a contingent, unpredictable investment in social space and time. How does one invest oneself in all the comings and goings-on at street-level of various Parisian quarters? [-@bergvall-constraint p. 44]

Bergvall remains ambivalent towards the more orthodox readings of the Oulipo that inform conceptual poetry, which equates constraints with axioms or algorithms whose execution is a merely perfunctory affair. If *Eunoia* concludes with a tribute to Perec that identifies the French author with the lipogram conceived as law or dogma (“nevertheless, Perec’s creed gets expressed; nevertheless, Perec’s tenet gets preserved” [100]), Bergvall instead reads his attempts to chart the infra-ordinary as a futile struggle against incompletion.[^oulipo-factor] Constraint neither guarantees the seamless execution of a work nor insulates the writer from the contingency of the world he describes. Bergvall later quotes Paul Virilio’s portrait of Perec (with whom he co-founded the journal *Cause Commune*) as a situationist *flâneur* who wanders the streets of Paris with an ear attuned to the *bruits de fond* or ambient noise of the city that engulfs him. Although Bergvall situates these writings “at the most anodyne, anonymous, yet structured level possible,” this structure also allows Perec to register the contingent effects of time on the body and embodied memory: “Structuring time spent in sites, in places, is simply structuring the oncoming of forgetting” [-@bergvall-infraordinary 102–3]. More aligned with the reading of Perec that I present in my first chapter, then, Bergvall characterizes constraint-based writing as a productive tension between the tentative and the exhaustive, countering the way that conceptual poetry (at least in its most canonical guise) seeks to bracket contingency.

[^oulipo-factor]: For a more sustained comparison between Bök and Bergvall, see Marjorie Perloff, “The Oulipo Factor.” Perloff reads these two poets not just as neo-Oulipians but as heirs to a more capacious poetic formalism with roots in the historic avant-gardes. Departing from the rhetoric of conceptualism (which holds that a poem is reducible to the articulation of its generative constraint), Perloff aligns the Oulipo and its successors with the modernist (and Russian formalist) argument that moments of heightened artifice serve to estrange and thereby renew our atrophied attentiveness to form. Bök and Bergvall, in this reading, serve as antidotes to a contemporary scene awash with naïvely confessional lyrics that Perloff disparages (with a nod to Ezra Pound’s *A Few Don’ts by an Imagiste*) as little more than lineated prose.

    Although Perloff has been instrumental in forging transatlantic and transhistorical connections between modernism, the Oulipo, and contemporary anglophone poetry, the division she makes here between lyric expression and avant-garde formalism has come under attack in recent years, especially by critics associated with the new lyric studies. For a judicious account of the lyric/avant-garde divide (and a careful reading of Perloff’s formative dissertation on Yeats), see Izenberg, *Being Numerous*.

### “Via”

The tension that Bergvall finds in *Lieux* – between the momentum of its durational constraint and the tentative (and ultimately unfulfilled) promise of its execution – also animates her most explicitly constraint-based poem. In “Via: 48 Dante Variations,” she transcribes and collates English translations of the first tercet of the *Inferno*, using all the editions housed in the British Library before May 2000 – exactly seven centuries after Dante is said to begin his journey. Discounting latecomers and manuscripts under restoration, she collects forty-seven versions in all, alphabetizes and numbers them, and removes all paratextual details except the author’s surname and the date of publication. What emerges, in her own words, is a “musicalised sense of panic … a perfect plot in the massing of time”.[^panic] The haunting refrain of the same words repeated again and again with subtle yet telling variations gives readers the sense that we too, like Dante, are lost in a dark wood. Here is the original Italian, followed by the first five tercets:

> Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita  
> mi ritrovai per una selva oscura  
> che la diritta via era smarrita.

> 1. Along the journey of our life half way  
> 	I found myself again in a dark wood  
> 	wherein the straight road no longer lay.  
> 	(Dale, 1996)

> 2. At the midpoint in the journey of our life  
> 	I found myself astray in a dark wood  
> 	For the straight path had vanished.  
> 	(Creagh and Hollander, 1989)

> 3. [HALF]{.smallcaps} over the wayfaring of our life,  
> 	Since missed the right way, through a night-dark wood  
> 	Struggling, I found myself.  
> 	(Musgrave, 1893)

> 4. Half way along the road we have to go,  
> 	I found myself obscured in a great forest,  
> 	Bewildered, and I knew I had lost the way.  
> 	(Sisson, 1980)

> 5. Halfway along the journey of our life  
> 	I woke in wonder in a sunless wood  
> 	For I had wandered from the narrow way  
> 	(Zappulla, 1998)

<!---[-@bergvall-via 1-24]-->

[^panic]: The phrase is from an unpublished draft of the poem (ctd. in Perloff 38). In *Fig*, Bergvall describes the original Italian in similar terms:

    > I had started this piece by accident. Stumbling upon Dante’s shadeless souls on my way to other books. Perhaps following a lead, in the dark of dark, in the woods of woods, in the sense of panic of the opening canto: 1-2-3 1-2-3 1-2-3 1-2-3 lines, and the three menace him. (64)

First composed as a score for digitally-processed voice (in collaboration with the Irish composer Ciarán Maher) and later published in *Chain* magazine alongside other seminal works of conceptual poetry, “Via” is both a poem and a work of new media – despite the fact that it was written entirely by hand. Generated by a constraint that determines every dimension of its form in advance, the poem demonstrates what Craig Dworkin calls the “proleptic” character of texts by human authors that nevertheless “anticipate the computerized new media that would seem to be their ideal vehicle” (“Imaginary” 30). In this sense, “Via” deviates from a high modernist poetics that often invokes Dante (and medieval poetry in general) as a metonym for craftsmanship and innovation. Eliot’s famous epigram to the *Wasteland* (“For Ezra Pound, *il miglior fabbro*”: the better craftsman, Dante’s praise for the troubadour Arnaut Daniel in *Purgatorio* [XXVI]{.smallcaps}) gives way to the figure of the scribe or the scrivener who aspires merely to copy rather than to create. If Eliot’s epigram registers a sense of *agon* or competition among friendly or not-so-friendly rivals (implying that Pound is *il miglior fabbro*, but Eliot the better poet), Bergvall’s poem works to systematically dissolve any hierarchy or logic of succession among the authors it compiles: poet translators (Pinsky, Longfellow, even Rosetti, whose version Pound praises in *The Spirit of Romance*) are lost amid the rabble of so many anonymous others, reduced to a string of surnames that echo and chatter like the personae trapped in the *Inferno* itself. This tension between singular innovation and divergent translation plays off an infamous crux in the original tercet: as Leo Spitzer observes, Dante finds *himself* (“mi retrovai”) precisely in the middle of *our* life (“nostra vita”), a doubling effect that encompasses the poem as a whole and gives the texture of singular experience to an allegorical journey that is shared by all.[^spitzer] “Via” extends this analogy between the singular *mi* and the plural *nostra* to a contemporary milieu where poets freely sample the words of others in an effort to dissolve the authority of the lyric voice – or rather to register the way in which new media at the turn of the millennium (and the remix culture that accompanies their emergence) render an enduring belief in lyric ontology both impossible and obsolete.

[^spitzer]: Spitzer critiques biographical interpretations of the *Commedia* for “their confusion of the ‘poetic I’ with the empirical or pragmatic ’I’ of the poet – who, in the very first lines of his poem, has taken care to present his ‘poetic I’ as representative of humanity.” Rather, the opening tercet figures Dante as a “composite ‘I’” that sublates the individual into the universal even as it requires “an individual eye ... to perceive and to fix the matter of experience” [-@spitzer 416].

Even as the poem works to deskill poetic labor, then, dismantling the modernist vision of the poet as singular craftsman, it also engages with an emergent poetics of the database. Bergvall enumerates and alphabetizes the translations into an index that permits random access, inviting readers to skim and skip among the various stanzas without privileging the original tercet as the only viable point of departure. And while this indexical structure promises a semblance of order, a way of disambiguating an otherwise vertiginous array of copies, Bergvall ultimately sabotages her index by making its interface unusable. Disregarding more conventional indices such as the author’s surname or the date of publication, the poem instead alphabetizes each translation by its first letter, transforming the left margin into a string of repetitions (seven lines begin with *half*, eleven with *in*, nineteen with *midway*, and four with *upon*) whose indexical principle forecloses at the outset any imaginable use. Like the giant *S* on first page of *Ulysses* (severed from the word *stately* on the next verso), the first letter of each stanza bears a merely contingent relation to the text that follows, calling attention to its own graphic and phonetic texture (with a nod to the drop capitals and rubricated initials of illuminated manuscripts) while, at the same time, thwarting the accessibility of the very system it instantiates. Just as *Eunoia* provides an interface to the dictionary that delights readers precisely to the degree that it could never help them locate specific words (since its lexicon is entirely monovocalic and its sequence is narrative rather than alphabetical), “Via” turns the list into a literary and aesthetic form by divesting it of any instrumental value. As Perec does with enumeration, she unravels a highly technical form – the alphabetical index – by extending its principle to an absurd extreme.

Although Bergvall remains ambivalent about her association with conceptual writing, “Via” shares with poems such as *Eunoia* an effort not only to borrow formal structures from new media, but also to disrupt their systematizing logic. In “The Imaginary Solution,” Craig Dworkin argues that conceptual poetry (as well as its precursors among the Oulipo and the Collège de ’Pataphysique) reveals errors and glitches within the edifice of the database that undermine its fantasy of seamlessly integrated data:

> [The absurdity generated by constraints] points to the inevitable discontinuity between all generalized systems and the incongruous individuals those systems are meant to account for; to the alienation of each concrete experience from the narratives of normalcy meant to absorb it; to the proscriptive inadequacy of descriptive schemes. In literary terms, these works contrast a formal rigidity, guaranteed by their preestablished rules, with the fluid interchangeability of the content structured by that form. (38)

The preceding chapters have all furnished examples of this mode of critique: Perec’s attempt to inventory his annual diet, which runs aground on the et cetera of appetite (a theme that returns in Bergvall’s “Fried Tale,” a list of every mention of food and drink in Chaucer’s *Canterbury Tales*); Calvino’s dialectic between the algorithmic logic of chess and the suspended time of ekphrasis in *Invisible Cities*; and, perhaps most relevant here, Bök’s distillation of the dictionary into a poetic reverie that renounces its own desire for disaffected mastery through the nimble play of the vowels. More minimalist and understated than any of these projects, “Via” is no less relentless in its deconstruction of the database genre, tugging at the seams not only of Dante’s epic (whose authority unravels in the face of its endless variations) but also of the list that gives these variations their form. A handful of recurring elements (*journey*, *road*, *myself*, *life*) serve as a leitmotif that throws each deviation into greater relief: the wood is by turns *obscure*, *sunless*, *gloomy*, *darksome*, *dusky*, or *shadowed*; the road is either *lost* or *misplaced*. Like Gertrude Stein’s injunction to begin again, Dante’s epiphany (“I found myself again”) echoes throughout these translations as a reminder that no two are alike, that there is no such thing as repetition. Recalling Perec’s definition of enumeration as a perennial tension between perfection and incompletion, Bergvall describes the way that error threatens to corrupt her seemingly irrefragable procedure:

> Surprisingly, more than once, I had to go back to the books to double-check and amend an entry, a publication date, a spelling. Checking each line, each variation, twice. Increasingly, the project was about keeping count, making sure. That what I was copying was what was there. Not to inadvertently change what had been printed. To reproduce each translative gesture. (*Fig* 65)

Each variation is itself threatened by variation, differing not only from the original Italian but also from itself, twice transcribed and so exposed, even if exactly copied, to the difference inherent in repetition. The poem’s subtitle (“48 Dante Variations,” although there are only forty-seven) implies that even the original tercet, cited as an epigram at the top of the text, constitutes a variation, an origin devoid of originality, no more and no less authoritative than the multitude of translations it inspires. In this flat network of stanzas, ordered only by the arbitrary sequence of the alphabet and linked by the irregular echo of a refrain, no voice, no version, has priority over any other. The order promised by the list (and the encyclopedic ambitions of the medieval epic it distills) converges with a dispersion of registers and dialects. Not even alphabetization – our most ubiquitous and indomitable method of organizing text – can reabsorb the centrifugal force of a poem that seems determined (no less than Perec’s tentative inventories) to dismantle the very principle on which its form depends.

In the essay cited above, Dworkin goes on to argue that conceptualism’s *détournement* of new media also works to expose forms of information management that subtend more sinister projects such as mass surveillance, drone warfare, and (more recently, with the advent of Web 2.0) the commodification of the affective labor performed by online communities. In this way, he offers a riposte to the widespread objection that conceptual writing is politically disengaged and naïvely optimistic about the emancipatory potential of digital technologies. Yet there is a danger here: if the political stakes of conceptualism are tied to its ability to expose the structural artifice of systems larger than itself, that is, to function as a *symptom* of new media, this desire for exposure also threatens to re-inscribe the very phenomenon it sets out to critique. This is what Eve Sedgwick calls “paranoid reading” [-@sedgwick03 123]: the ways in which literary and cultural critics feel compelled to expose the complicity of literature with historically-conditioned structures of power. Paranoia in this sense is highly contagious: the impulse to expose an object that is itself concerned with exposure – digital surveillance, for example – partakes of that object’s own desire to withdraw to a vantage that affords unchecked mastery. If the critical work of conceptualism is to register a widespread paranoia about the politics of digitization, it risks adopting those politics as its own.

For Sedgwick, the real danger of paranoid reading is not that it misses its target, that our suspicion will turn out to be unjustified or misplaced. The danger is that paranoia leaves no room for other modes of reading (including “the weaving of intertextual discourse” [150]) that serve to sustain precarious selves and communities in a world that is indifferent to their nurture. Sedgwick describes an alternative practice of “reparative reading” that might offset our discipline’s obsession with critique: to suspend judgement, to read with the grain, in ways that “assemble and confer plenitude on an object that will then have resources to offer an inchoate self” [-@sedgwick03 149]. This reparative impulse also has a temporal dimension, assembling fragments of the past into eclectic heaps that are “*not necessarily like any preexisting whole*” [-@sedgwick03 128]. Such assemblages cannot be totalized or normalized precisely because they are belated and asynchronous – which is to say, as Elizabeth Freeman adds in a gloss on this passage, “we can’t know in advance, but only retrospectively if even then, what is queer and what is not” [-@freeman10 p. xiii].

Repair has been a key concept for queer theorists who seek to oppose normative regimes of time that are constitutive of modernity (the linear time of reproductive genealogy, the cyclical time of domestic labor). If, as Freeman argues, modernity compels us to move in lockstep with historical time (or what she calls “chrononormativity”), yolking lived experience to temporal regimes that are irreversible, teleological, and homogenous, we can also break out of this regimen by engaging in reparative practices that cut across time and imagine temporal modes that are wayward and nonlinear. This is partly why queer temporality has enjoyed such a rich following among medievalists: the medieval (or the premodern more generally) often appears as the term that modernity must exclude in order to delimit itself as adequately secularized and disenchanted.[^dinshaw] The endurance of the medieval within the modern or the contemporary, then, registers a profound dissatisfaction with concepts of modernity that are defined by historical progress and enlightened critique.

[^dinshaw]: For a felicitous example of such scholarship, see @dinshaw12, *How Soon Is Now*, which traces the afterlives of medieval literature and philosophy (especially in the work of amateur philologists) in order to uncover “forms of desirous, embodied being that are out of sync with the ordinary linear measurements of everyday life” (5). Also see Cole and Smith, *The Legitimacy of the Middle Ages*, a sustained critique of Reinhart Koselleck’s theory of modernity as a self-legitimating break with the premodern[-@legitimacy].

In this light, “Via” performs a mode of queer time not only by rewriting a medieval text and its modern afterlives, but by doing so within a poetic form that is structurally asynchronous. By alphabetizing the text, Bergvall disrupts the historical chronology of the translations, charging the gap between each tercet with a leap backwards or forwards in time. Such leaps are formally marked both by rapid variations in style (by turns archaic, minimalist, or colloquial) and by the fluctuating dates, positioned emphatically at the end of each stanza, that punctuate our time travel even as their rhyming digits form a sort of unifying refrain (1989, 1893, 1998, 1993). On the one hand, these points of temporal rupture look back to the paratactic, collage-based techniques of the modernist epic: Pound’s *Cantos*, for example, partly modeled on Dante’s *Commedia*, assembles fragments of text from disparate moments of history, where the gap or cut between each pair of fragments, as with cinematic montage, radically disrupts our sense of linear time. But Bergvall’s poem, by contrast, works to dull the disruptive force of parataxis, its potential to shock, demystify, or estrange. Absent here are the aggressive shifts in dialect, register, voice, or syntax that poets of the Pound era use to roughen the texture of language in an effort to emancipate readers from automatized habits of perception. Bergvall alters her sources as little as possible: the diction and syntax of the poem, while sometimes archaic or obscure, always remains legible, and paratext such as names or dates, unlike the notoriously obfuscating footnotes to the *Wasteland*, form a complete (if radically disordered) system of reference. Her original performance of the poem, dirge-like and mellifluent, accompanied by a subharmonic drone synthesized from her own voice, sutures the otherwise hetereoglossic stanzas into a continuous stream of vocables. Hers is what Tan Lin calls an “ambient poetics,” a mode of appropriation that foregoes “radical disjuncture” and the “shock effect of montage” for an aesthetic or even anesthetic experience that is “relaxing, boring, absorptive, sampled freely and without effort.”<!---[-@lin09]--> The ambient texture of “Via” emerges partly through the miscellany of affects invoked by the translations: for Musgrave, Dante is *struggling*; for Sisson, *bewildered*; for Zappulla, he *wakes in wonder*. None of these words appears in the Italian (which says nothing about how Dante *feels*, only that he is lost) and yet as a group they index the very feelings of struggle, bewilderment, and wonder that readers are apt to experience as they wend their way among the maze of variations. The cumulative force of these affects properly belongs neither to the medieval poet nor to any of his translators: unmoored from any one persona, affect circulates freely among the stanzas and across the many centuries they encompass. Like the denizens of the *Inferno*, who each suffer alone and yet form a chorus by virtue of their mutual inclusion in the poem, the network of feelings at play in “Via” gives rise to a community of asynchronous voices that forestall the normative momentum of historical time.

Bergvall’s method of assembling divergent texts without provoking shock or estrangement also recalls theories of the lyric as an unheroic or inconsequential genre, suspending narrative time without making this suspension a model for redemptive action. Read this way, the queer time of “Via” resides less in specific moments of temporal rupture than in a pervasive disinclination to move forward. Bergvall does again and again what she has already done, copying the same words in minimally different combinations, often returning to the Library to double-check her work. This gesture of doubling back, of retracing one’s steps, mirrors the suspended temporality of the poem: like Dante lost in the dark wood, the time of transcription lags behind not only the text being copied, but also the copy itself, which is never self-identical or wholly at rest. We encounter here, in Bergvall’s words, less the “causal horror of linear travel” than “a narrative of structure, stop-start, each voice trying itself out, nothing looped, yet nothing moving beyond the first line, never beyond the first song, never beyond the first day” (ctd. in Perloff 39). The poem enacts the *ritrovai* of Dante’s original tercet, as the conflicted *I* finds himself again and again amid a catalogue of texts that have themselves been refound.

Comparing her work to the practice of digital sampling in electronic music (“stop-start … nothing looped”), Bergvall imagines a very different form of temporality than that of conceptualism’s procedural logic. The poem suspends epic momentum for lyric inconsequence, a time where nothing happens (or that *makes* nothing happen), withdrawing from the demand for redemptive action or narrative progression.[^françois] Bergvall lyricizes the *Inferno*, although hers is a lyric whose scene of solitary repose – a poet alone in the woods – is routinely thwarted by the proximity of other voices that resemble, without ever being equivalent to, his own. If there is a modernist Dante at play here, it is not Eliot’s *miglior fabbro*, tied, as I have argued, to the heroic rivalry of poets vying for the right to succession, but Belacqua, the indolent persona of *Purgatorio* [IV]{.smallcaps} (and a recurrent figure in Beckett’s novels and plays), who neglects to ascend the steps to Purgatory because, as he says, “O frate, andar in sù che porta?” (“O brother, what good would climbing do?” [127])[-@purgatorio]. “Via” assumes a similarly inoperative pose, Belaqua’s indolence – not, as for Dante, a vindication of his sin, but a disarmingly equivocal refusal to undertake decisive action or perform meaningful work – a refusal, in short, to make time count. There is a minimal yet crucial difference between such unheroic agency and conceptualism’s desire to supplant the lyric voice with the impersonality of a literate machine. Via,” to be sure, follows a programmatic logic that determines much of its structure in advance, but that logic also comes undone through its own figures of asynchrony, stoppage, and impasse. Readers are not forced to choose (as the rhetoric of conceptualism often implies) between unexamined complicity with the inhuman abstraction of digital systems, on the one hand, and, on the other, an avant-garde tactics that seeks to expose the contradictions of new media through radical forms of mimesis. Bergvall instead shows how the modes of temporal rupture that emerge from her alphabetical list thwart the sequential time both of the epic it rewrites and of the enumeration it performs, suspended within the pulse of its uncanny refrain.

[^françois]: My discussion of the unheroic here owes much to Anne-Lise François. In *Open Secrets*, François coins the term “lyric inconsequence” to describe romantic and post-romantic poems that do not so much valorize inaction as subtract it from any system of “demonstratable yields” where failure might secretly count as success [-@françois08 p. xvii].


### “The Not Tale”

“Via” sets the stage for a broader engagement with the premodern in Bergvall’s work, which frequently draws upon medieval poetry as a way of exploring questions of translation, repetition, and temporality. Her 2014 book *Drift*, for example, splices fragments of the Anglo-Saxon poem “The Seafarer” with the contemporary story of a migrant ship left adrift on the Mediterranean, absorbing the melancholic tone of the original while reminding readers that English, too, is a borderless tongue, its Latin script punctuated with *thorns* [þ] and *eths* [ð] that disrupt the fluency enforced by alphabetic writing. *Drift* builds in turn upon the 2011 collection *Meddle English*, which rewrites and appropriates portions of Chaucer’s *Canterbury Tales* into a new work that, like “Via,” makes transcription into a performative act. By way of conclusion, I wish to turn briefly to a poem from this book, entitled simply “The Not Tale,” that echoes and extends Bergvall’s abiding fascination with refrain as a form and its power to keep normative time in abeyance. Originally composed for the 2006 New Chaucer Society conference, at the invitation of Charles Bernstein and David Wallace, this project later appeared as a set of audio recordings on the online archive PennSound, under the working title “Shorter Chaucer Tales.” Like many of Bergvall’s intermedia texts, the printed versions collected in *Meddle English* retain and amplify, like scores or transcripts, both the irregularity of speech and the speechless noise that surrounds live performance. (Bergvall recalls that the preface to the book, “Middling English” derives from a lecture given at the Contemporary Women Writing Network in San Diego on 10 July 2010, when “[a]n earthquake Richter scale 5.9 shook the ground during the talk and influenced the final reworking” [160]).[^toothache] Like “Via,” *Meddle English* explores the indeterminate space between speech and text, between the projected persona of a lyric poem and the embodied poet who reads it aloud, asking what is lost when the grain of the voice is transliterated into the discrete letters of the alphabetic code. At the same time, the use of Chaucer as a source allows Bergvall to explore a form of historical English that precedes the rise of standardized spelling, which allows for a degree of slippage between the written and the spoken, registering traces of accents and dialects that have since faded from modern usage.<!---You’e not just saying that we no longer speak or recognize Middle English, although that’s part of the argument here … it’s a foreign text … a foreignness *within* English (which is part. of Derrida’s argument re: hospitality) but also that it more loosely and fluidly approximates the flux of speech, it’s not as codified as modern English.--> For Bergvall, Middle English offers a way to unearth “indicators and practices of language in flux, of thought  in making,” (17) and which Bergvall sees as re-emerging in the fluid and protean language of the web. If “Via” returns to a hypercanonical poem in order to reveal both its self-difference and the differences that unfold within and among its English translations, *Meddle English* extends this work by turning to the unstable origins of English itself, a creole forged through the collision of many languages that have yet to be standardized into a common tongue.

In the preface, Bergvall draws an extended analogy between a figure she calls the *midden* (“[a] dunghill, a dung heap; a refuse heap,” as well as “a domestic ash-pit” [“midden”]) and the archeological strata that make up the uneven history of English, as well as the way that poets delve into that history in order to unearth “[i]ntercepted notions of the past” and the “[t]he tracing up of re-emergents” (9). Assembled from the detritus of Anglo-Saxon, French, Italian, and Latin, among other languages, the midden of Middle English is also, for Bergvall,  a thing made, a history that cannot be taken for granted or grasped from a single vantage, but rather “a rich field of lived and deductive approximations” gleaned from the “grain of the vocalizing, materializing text” (8). An image on the inside cover embodies this concept: the phrase “a heap of language,” scrawled four times in what looks like charcoal or magnified pencil (and reprinted again, inverted, on the back cover, where it looks more like chalk on a blackboard, a scholastic exercise written out in punishment), reveals the subtle variations that accrue when language is copied and amassed. The first line is missing the indefinite article, a smudge obscures the righthand side, the line spacing and kerning varies wildly, and many characters are overwritten (a literal version of the doubling back that Bergvall discovers in Dante’s *ritrovai*). This quatrain of jagged lines is indeed a sort of heap, an assemblage of iterations that shows language morphing and bending over time, a scribal copy of itself that repeats without ever perfectly duplicating the discourse that has come before. In this way, Bergvall hints at the outset that difference and repetition will again shape her poetic journey into the past, recording what she finds there letter by letter, even when those letters, like the now unpronounceable *þ*, have since been “dispensed with, like outmoded cooking utensils. Or pulled out, like teeth” (7).

First published in *Poetry* magazine in 2006, “The Not Tale” both describes and performs this labor of excavating English, composed as it is “by translating and excerpting the negatives that make up Chaucer’s description of Arcite’s funeral in ‘The Knight’s Tale.’” The opening couplet is a sort of midden unto itself:

> | The great labour of appearance
> | served the making of the pyre. (1-2)

Compare Chaucer’s version, which is a little more verbose:

> | Heigh labour and ful greet apparaillynge
> | Was at the service and the fyr-makynge.

Bergvall translates *apparaillynge* (a gerund of *appareil*, “[f]urnishings, trappings, accouterments,” like the modern *apparel*, although also, in this context, “[p]reparations, as for a festival or for battle”) into *appearance*, encompassing both the spectacle of the funeral as well as the work that appearance and disappearance, presence and absence, will perform in the lines that follow. *Pyre* (from Greek *πυρά*: fire) rather than *fyr* serves to hellenize the text – “The Knight’s Tale,” after all, takes place at the court of Theseus, duke of Athens – but also to emphasize the structure itself (“[a] pile or heap of wood or other combustible material” [“pyre”]) as a metaphor for Bergvall’s method, accumulating fragments from Chaucer’s text and stacking them atop one another (while burning off the excess, as if the ends of the abbreviated lines had been singed). Bergvall undertakes the “making of the pyre,” and the *makynge* of English, as a “labour of appearances,” assembling a heap of Chaucerian lines that together form a lament, not for an obsolete tongue or bygone era, but for the middle, the substantive core, that would make this striated language cohere. For all its imperial ambitions, Bergvall suggests, English is still a language in flux, a pile or pyre of linguistic refuse, composed not of lexicons and grammars but of flotsam and jetsam, unable to fully disentangle itself from the other languages it enfolds.

The symmetry promised by the opening couplet swiftly devolves into fragments, some of them lifted straight out of Chaucer’s text and others translated by Bergvall, although the relative paucity of archaic spellings, compared to the other tales in *Meddle English*, make it hard to tell which is which:

> | But how
> | nor how
> | How also
> | how they
> | shal nat be toold
> | shall not be told.
> | Nor how the gods
> | nor how the beestes and the birds
> | nor how the ground agast
> | Nor how the fire
> | first with straw
> | and then with drye
> | and then with grene
> | and then with gold
> | and then. (3-17)

More restrained in its use of non-standard spelling than the other poems in *Meddle English*, “The Not Tale” places its emphasis on the act of negation – as well as the conjunction *nor* that sutures these negations together. Chaucer is famous for his double (or even triple or quadruple) negatives, which never sum to a positive: when, in the General Prologue, he says of the Friar that “[t]her nas no man nowher so vertuous,” the adverb *nowher* amplifies rather than negates the contraction *nas*: there was *nowhere no* man so virtuous. Bergvall plays off such redundant negations , amplifying the poem’s elegiac tone while redirecting its work of mourning from Arcite, the Athenian knight whose death this funeral commemorates, to the poem itself, which strategically avoids invoking any grievable referent or explicit act of mourning. The repeated adverb *how* promises to qualify a verb that never appears, truncated by its own repetition, a sort of refrain, a loop stuck on repeat, that leaves the sentence incomplete, its subject absent and unmourned. Compulsively repeated, the *how* shifts from an adverb to one of the several uses that the [OED]{.smallcaps} defines as “elliptical”: “With ellipsis of the rest of the question, which, if expressed in full, would reflect the form of a previous statement or question,” followed by a similarly morbid example from *Romeo & Juliet*: “How if when I am laid into the Tombe, I wake before the time.” In this context, however, the question never gets expressed, and the *how*, left stranded, takes on an exclamatory force (“But how / nor how”) as if unable to comprehend the loss it struggles to name: but how could this have happened? When the verb finally does arrive, it is by way of a negation, or stronger, an injunction not to speak: “how they / shal nat be toold / shall not be told.” If the death of Arcite shall not be told (or *tolled*, another homophone that echoes in the refrain), that is because the tale itself has literally been expunged. Bergvall systematically omits almost all verbs, proper nouns, and other parts of speech that would identify the subject of this funeral or recount the events that precipitate his death. Instead, she presents a pyre of adverbial phrases whose negations and omissions register a more profound sense of loss than could any positive account: as with her rewriting of Dante, she stalls the epic temporality of the medieval text by looping phrases that do nothing and lead nowhere, suspended in the lyric time of its halting refrain. To tell, as I observe in my first chapter, is both to count and recount, to tell a tale or tell a rosary, to let events unfold in a chronological sequence that can be measured by the hands of a clock. By proclaiming, with Chaucer, that the tale shall not be told, Bergvall refuses to make grief countable or make death enumerable. The shift from epic action to lyric reticence that unfolds also in “Via” (and with a comparable sense of bewilderment and vertigo) becomes entangled here with a melancholic compulsion to repeat – not the death of Arcite, but the incomplete gesture of mourning itself, which the poem forbids from running its course.

Hence the truncated ending of this stanza: after a series of anaphoric lines (“and then with drye / and then with grene / and then with gold”) that initiate a sort of epic catalogue, the sentence cuts off abruptly: “and then.” And then what? The line carries a faint echo of the opening of Pound’s *Cantos*, which begins with a translation of Book [XI]{.smallcaps} of Homer’s Odyssey (by way of a latin crib by Antonius Divus): “And then went down to the ship.” Pound’s line implies a continuity with the epic tradition, picking up where Homer left off, *in medias res*, with a subjectless verb that embodies the *imagiste* virtues of concrete diction of direct action. (That the most vital part of speech for Pound is the verb, not the noun, and even less the adverb or the adjective, is already the central argument of his 1919 edition of Ernest Fenollosa’s *The Chinese Written Character as a Medium for Poetry*.) Bergvall, however, omits the verb, ending rather than beginning her stanza with “and then”: whatever continuity or futurity this phrase might have promised is severed, like Arcite’s life, by a full stop. (The *Cantos*, incidentally, also begin with mourning: the Ithacans leave their comrade Elpenor unburied on Circe’s island, “our bodies also / Heavy with weeping,” only to meet him again in the afterlife, after burning a pyre to summon the spirit of Tiresias. But these rites serve to usher readers into the underworld of the poem; they do not tarry long with the memory of the dead.) The *and then* comes at the end (or in the truncated middle) of a list that describes the materials used to fashion the pyre, which Bergvall also crops short:

> | And thanne with drye stikkes cloven a thre,
> | And thanne with grene wode and spicerye,
> | And thanne with clooth of gold and with perrye ... (2934-6)

In this sense, the *and then* also carries the force of an *et cetera* (from the Latin, “and the rest”), gesturing towards other adornments that Bergvall elides. (Chaucer also lists garlands and myrrh, as well as wine, milk, and blood, which Bergvall includes later in her poem.) Breaking off the list early and pruning its elements amplifies the sense of omission and negation that builds throughout the stanza, falling silent at just that moment when the narrative seems poised to begin in earnest. And then (something happened): even as this plot device announces the onset of an event, or a series of events, that would make of the list a tale, the stanza interrupts the sequence and calls attention to the elision of all the things that *might* have happened, but will not. (This is also an elegiac trope, of course: to lament the lost future of the untimely dead.)

<!---TODO: Also mention another poem by Bergvall that ends “this is the & of the world.”-->

After another litany of negations (and the briefest of allusions to funeral offerings: “and cups full of wine and milk / and blood / into the fyr”), the poem ends with a fragile sense of closure:

> | Nor how three times
> | and three times with
> | and three times how
> | and how that
> | Now how
> | nor how
> | nor how
> | nor who
> | I cannot tell
> | nor can I say
> | but shortly to the point
> | I turn
> | and give my tale an end. (32-44)

The repetition of “three times” (a translation of Chaucer’s *thrice*, which appears in the Middle English, as it does here, in a triplet) preserves the ritualistic chant of the original while eliding the funeral rites themselves. A cavalry of Greeks circle the pyre three times, and each time their spears clatter, and each time the ladies weep:

> | Ne how the Grekes, with an huge route,
> | Thries riden al the fyr aboute
> | Upon the left hand, with a loud shoutynge,
> | And thries with hir speres claterynge,
> | And thries how the ladyes gonne crye. (2951-5)

Chaucer’s syntax is already a little elliptical: the second and third instances of “[a]nd thries” seem to refer back to the riding, not to the clattering or weeping, although the passage also implies that these sounds unfold in synchrony, as if a cry were raised each time the Greeks do a circuit. Bergvall condenses the syntax even further, leaving only a trailing*with* and *how* that qualify actions we never see. As with the previous stanza, the elision amplifies a refrain already implicit in Chaucer’s text, shifting attention from the rites performed by the Greeks to the incantation of the poem itself, which repeats itself three times and so enacts the very ritual it describes. Like the Greeks around the pyre, the poem circles around an absent center, doubling or tripling back in a compulsive repetition that skirts the edge of a loss it cannot name. If Bergvall cuts short this ceremony with a detour, jumping swiftly from one Chaucerian line to the next, it is a detour with no destination, echoing the tripartite structure of the Greek’s dirge while hollowing out its content. This performance utterance, in the end, does not do what it says: if elegy as a genre often constitutes a speech act that promises to resurrect the dead in memory (“He lives, he wakes—’tis Death is dead, not he,” as Shelly puts it in “Adonis”), Bergvall abandons the resurrection before it even begins: although earlier moments in the poem allude to actual rites (“And cups full of wine and milk / and blood / into the fyr”), also in groups of three, the refrain of “three times” that marks its crescendo offers no closure, truncating verbs into prepositions, clanging and weeping into *with* and *how*, as if these words were themselves part of the ceremony, each chanted thrice in unison. By collating these repetitive fragments (all of which appear in Chaucer, one after another, with just a little more filler), Bergvall transforms a stylistic quirk into a melancholic stammer, a broken loop that keeps circling back on itself to avoid confronting an unspeakable loss.

What loss? As the lines get even shorter and more repetitive (“and how that / Nor how / nor how / nor how / nor who“), the *how* morphs into a *who*, as if to ask: who are we mourning? Not only is Arcite dead, but so is his memory: the Greeks seem to have forgotten even the name of the one they grieve. By truncating Chaucer’s lines, Bergvall systematically avoids naming or even alluding to their melancholic object. “The Not Tale” stages an elegy without a departed, neither commemorating nor reviving the memory of the dead. If something is lost here, it is the text that Bergvall has omitted: deprived of their original referent, the Chaucerian dirge seems to lament its own partial erasure, the space between (and within) the lines where words have been left out. As with Perequian enumeration, what appears at first an additive practice, assembling fragments into a coherent whole, also appears subtractive in retrospect, eliding all the things that do not fit under its rubric. Bergvall describes her process as “translating and excerpting the negatives that make up Chaucer’s description of Arcite’s funeral in ‘The Knight’s Tale,’” subtly implying (with the verb *excerpt*, literally to pluck out) that she performs her own form of negation by omitting every line that does not say *not*, *never*, or *nor*. Like the more explicitly negational genre of erasure poetry I will explore in the next chapter, “The Not Tale” turns an elegy for a dead youth into an elegy for a foreshortened text, bending the melancholic force of Chaucerian negation toward its own redactive procedure.

Even as the ending promises closure (“but shortly to the point / I turn / and give my tale an end”), this turn is yet another fragment: nothing follows that would give the tale its point (also a grim pun for Arcite, who dies in a joust). In the Middle English, the Knight who tells the tale pokes fun at his own verbosity: “But shortly to the point thanne wol I wende / And maken of my longe tale an ende” (2965-6). Disrupting the punning symmetry between *long* and *short*, Bergvall omits the former and reframes the latter as a reflection on her own method, which redacts the Middle English text into what she elsewhere calls her “Shorter Chaucer Tales.” More striking is the shift from *make* to *give*: Bergvall must give her poem an end, cutting it short, because the body of the poem refuses to end, recycling itself in fragments while neglecting to commit Arcite’s corpse to the fire. What Jahan Ramazani calls the “compensatory economy” of elegy, lamenting the dead so they live on in memory, is short-circuited here, its transaction incomplete. The deceased is still unnamed (and therefore unmourned), and what the poem gives readers, at its close, is not so much an end as a middle (or a midden), an unlit pyre of fragments that refuse to form a coherent whole.

<!---TODO:
1. Talk about the three in terms of number. Telling. And *not* progressing. (You have notes on this somewhere already.)
2. Talk about the final lines.√
3. Loop back to your discussion of lyrics that make nothing happen.
4. Also note the subtle shift from how to who (which is both literal and phonic: a substituted letter, or a near homophone, a slant rhyme).-->

[^toothache]: For another example of this interplay between transcription and embodied performance, see Bergvall’s note on her poem “About Face,” which encodes stutters caused by a toothache:

    > This text started as a performance for the Liminal Institute Festival in Berlin in 1999. I had just had a painful tooth pulled out and could read neither very clearly nor very fast. Tape players with German and English conversations on the text were circulated among the audience. It took 45 minutes to perform the materials. For its 2nd showing at Bard College, I speeded up the tapes, transcribed the snaps of half-heard materials, and integrated these to the performing voice. The reading was curated by Nicholas Johnson. By now, it took 10 minutes to read.
