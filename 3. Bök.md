# Letters Enfettered: Christian Bök’s *Eunoia*

“Constraint, as everyone knows, has a bad press,” writes Marcel Bénabou. “All those who esteem the highest value in literature to be sincerity, emotion, realism, or authenticity mistrust it as a strange and dangerous whim” (40). Few books of contemporary poetry are as whimsical (or as dangerous, some might say) as Christian Bök’s *Eunoia*. Inspired by the Oulipo, the book follows a simple premise: each of the five chapters uses a single vowel. The resultant text reads something like a truncated dictionary, a Rabelaisian catalogue of obscure words that nevertheless form a surprisingly legible and compelling narrative. Despite its difficulty, *Eunoia* has been wildly successful: it is the most popular book of poetry in Canadian history, an international bestseller (hitting number eight on Amazon.uk a few weeks after its British publication), and the winner of the prestigious 2002 Griffin Prize for Poetry. It has been choreographed for dance ensemble, mined for hiphop lyrics, and translated into emoji.[^eunoia-adaptations] The book’s success – almost unprecedented in the world of experimental poetry – has also fueled the animosity of its detractors, who complain (as Bénabou might predict) that Bök trades authentic expression for gimmickry and repartee.[^against-conceptualism]

What is it about *Eunoia* that appears so threatening to its critics? How can a text so widely celebrated by its mainstream readers also elicit suspicion and contempt from other contemporary poets? Perhaps it is because *Eunoia* flaunts its constraint with a gusto that seems to preclude the sort of hesitancy we find in Perec and Calvino, embracing the procedural and the programmatic without leaving adequate space for their critique. Bök frames the practice of writing under constraint as a tedious affair that resembles, or even exemplifies, the forms of disaffected, deskilled labor that characterize post-industrial life. *Eunoia* foregoes *otium* for *labor* – and so appears both to capitulate to the capitalist demand for calculable yields, dismissing poetry’s potential to resist that demand through radical forms of indolence and reverie. This is a narrative, however, that I will push back against: a close reading of *Eunoia* together with Bök’s scholarly work on ’pataphysics suggest that his poetry is both more lyrical and more radical than either he or his critics are often willing to admit.

The postface to *Eunoia* describes its procedure in detail:

> ‘Eunoia’ is the shortest word in English to contain all five vowels, and the word quite literally means ‘beautiful thinking.’ *Eunoia* is a univocal lipogram, in which each chapter restricts itself to the use of a single vowel. *Eunoia* is directly inspired by the exploits of Oulipo . . . the avant-garde coterie renowned for its literary experimentation with extreme formalistic constraints. The text makes a Sisyphean spectacle of its labour, willfully crippling its language in order to show that, even under such improbable conditions of duress, language can still express an uncanny, if not sublime, thought. (103)

*Eunoia* takes after Perec’s *La Disparition*, a 300-page novel that omits the letter *e* (a true feat in French, preventing the use of almost all feminine nouns as well as the masculine definite article). A parody of hard-boiled detective fiction, *La Disparition* tells the story of several friends in search of a companion, Anton Vowl, whose absence (like the vowel missing from his name) becomes an allegory both for the lipogram itself and for the chaos that follows in its wake. Dozens of characters are murdered on the verge of pronouncing the forbidden letter: the Corsican detective Ottavio Ottaviani, for example, spontaneously dies just as he is about to announce that the text he is reading, a poem without the letter *a*, also lacks the letter *e* (“Mais il n’y a pas non plus d’ …”).

Like Perec’s novel, *Eunoia* obeys one of the founding principles of potential literature: “a text written according to a constraint describes the constraint” (Roubaud 41 – 2). Constraints are generative as well as restrictive: they shape the content whose expression they constrain. The opening salvo of each chapter is glibly self-reflexive: “Awkward grammar appalls a craftsman” (1); “Enfettered, these letters repress free speech” (31); “Writing is inhibiting” (50). And, as with Perec, characters die on the brink of saying the unsayable: Hassan, the protagonist of Chapter A, expires amid a “grand mal spasm and, *ahh*, gasps a schwa, as a last gasp” (30). But there are more constraints:

> All chapters must allude to the art of writing. All chapters must describe a culinary banquet, a prurient debauch, a pastoral tableau and a nautical voyage. All sentences must accent internal rhyme through the use of syntactical parallelism. The text must exhaust the lexicon for each vowel, citing at least 98% of the available repertoire (although a few words do go unused, despite efforts to include them: *parallax*, *belvedere*, *gingivitis*, *monochord*, and *tumulus*). The text must minimize repetition of substantive vocabulary (so that, ideally, no word appears more than once). The letter Y is suppressed. (103 – 4)

Many of these constraints are also Oulipian. The goal of exhausting the available lexicon recalls another common principle: “the Oulipian text actualizing a constraint [is] envisaged only on the condition that this text contain all the possibilities of the constraint” (Roubaud, “Deux Principes” 95). Raymond Queneau’s *Cent mille milliards de poèmes*, for example, does not just give us a new collection of sonnets; it gives us so many sonnets that even the most assiduous reader could never hope to read them all in a lifetime – indeed, the work relieves poets of the need to write a sonnet ever again.[^queneau-sonnets] The Oulipian text generates an unmanageable surfeit that exhausts the novelty of its constraint. Kenneth Goldsmith’s endorsement in the book’s blurb is apt: “*Eunoia* takes the lipogram and renders it obsolete.”

Even *Eunoia*’s thematic content seems to derive from the constraint: by Bök’s own account, the four principle motifs (banquet, debauch, tableau, voyage) emerge fortuitously out of the vocabulary common to all five vowels. By setting out to exhaust his repertoire, Bök seeks to reveal the latent preoccupations of the English language: what topics recur so frequently in the dictionary that we can speak of them even under the harshest of restrictions? Of course, the motifs are also suspiciously literary: Bök notes that they are “the kinds of scenarios that you typically see in Greek epic poetry” (“On Being Stubborn”). Chapter E, whose heroine is Helen of Troy, retells the entirety of Homer’s *Iliad* – and with a sense of elegance and poise that befits the epic tradition of aestheticizing violence: “When the helmeted men get pelted, the slender needles (*les fléchettes*) dent the crested helmets” (45).[^war-music] Bök would maintain, however, that Chapter E is only epic because the epic is deeply inscribed in the history of our language: not just centuries of translating the classics, but centuries of glorified combat have left English with a rich vocabulary for speaking eloquently about war.[^lipogram]

Despite its international success, *Eunoia* has not always met with enthusiasm. What some readers celebrate as the deftness and ingenuity of its *difficulté vaincue*, others see as an obsequious display of the poet’s labor. For many poets sympathetic to the lyric tradition, the book’s technical artifice comes at the expense of poetic affect: the book substitutes elbow grease and gimmickry for emotion recollected in tranquility. Bök would seem to agree: such a “Sisyphean spectacle,” he notes in the afterword, “has required seven years of daily perseverance for its consummation” (105). This is no joke. In an interview with Charles Bernstein, Bök recounts the duress of his writing process: an overworked graduate student at the University of York, holding down two jobs at sixty hours a week, he toiled away on the project from midnight to early dawn every night for the better part of a decade, gradually succumbing to the paranoid suspicion that the vowels themselves were conspiring against him (“On Being Stubborn”). The story is hyperbolic, of course, and possibly apocryphal, but it is part of the mythos of toil that has shaped *Eunoia*’s reception, a mythos promulgated by the text itself. Work is a recurrent motif in Bök’s oeuvre: by way of prefacing his recent translation of the fourth book of Virgil’s *Georgics*, for example, he explains how he micromanaged his workload by parsing the text into fifty blank verse sonnets, each to be completed in just under two days. He maintained this pace for the duration of the ninety-day project, mimicking Virgil’s own analogy between the geometrical structure of the beehive and the division of apian labor.[^xenotext-reading]

This emphasis on work has led many critics to dismiss *Eunoia* as “pointless toil.” The Canadian poet Carmine Starnino coins this phrase in an infamously scathing review that describes the book “not so much as a triumph of ambition as a triumph of stamina” (130): technically adept, yes, and a “spectacular *jeu d’esprit*,” but ultimately frivolous and without aesthetic merit. Starnino’s reading, for all its polemic, is representative of critiques leveled at the Oulipo in general: on the one hand, constraint-based writing appears juvenile and self-indulgent, indifferent to any extrinsic purpose beyond the reshuffling of written signs; on the other hand, it is ruthlessly logical to the point of masochism.
<!---TODO: Consider changing *masochism*-->

Such critiques are often indignant towards the Oulipo’s apparent disregard for the value of literary and artistic freedom: the sense that language games of this sort are fundamentally hostile to the free play of the imagination. Starnino condemns “such self-punishing acts of technical adroitness” not because they produce absurd results (130), but because they threaten the concept of the lyric as an organic form: “A difficulty mastered should never itself be the prompt that motivates poems into life, particularly since that difficulty will stop representing a danger the moment it can no longer shock the reader with its impossible surmise” (131). Novelty value has a half-life, no doubt, although Starnino’s point is also that the book fails to sustain its defamiliarizing effect because the procedure itself is static. If the effect of *Eunoia* is “attritional – less and less achieved,” that is because the constraint effectively generates the text in advance, foreclosing at the outset the dialectical play between literary form and aesthetic judgement on which lyric poetry depends. Starnino’s authority here is Coleridge: “The idea which puts the form together cannot itself be the form” (133). Poetry submits itself to the rigor of form in order to bring that form to life (and thereby justify its rigor in the first place); *Eunoia*, on the other hand, offers only the “confirmation of a conundrum solved” (133). Hence the irony of Starnino’s witty if spiteful remark that *Eunoia* places “authorship” on “autopilot” (134): the procedure submits poetry to just the kind of tedium and automatism that the avant-garde’s tactics of *ostranenie* set out to disrupt. If *Eunoia* estranges conservative readers who expect poetry to be expressive, it also estranges many avant-garde readers who see its constraint as an affront to aesthetic freedom and an effort to subdue the contingency of quotidian life.[^nitpicking]

One way to defend *Eunoia* against this charge is to argue that the constraint does, in fact, generate surprising images and turns of phrase that are every bit as pleasurable as those we find in poetry written with all five vowels. If we accept that poetry is characterized less by personal expression than by verbal originality (the traditional formalist defense of the genre), *Eunoia* is poetic indeed: the constraint gives rise to highly improbable yet beautiful sentences that would otherwise have been unthinkable. The book is multi-generic, rich in literary allusions, and tonally complex, ranging from somber elegy to ribald humor and epigrammatic wit. In her influential essay “The Oulipo Factor,” Marjorie Perloff defends *Eunoia* on precisely these grounds: not only do such constrained texts reward (and continue to reward) close reading; they give us an antidote to a pervasive lack of formal competence among contemporary poets who see language as a self-effacing vehicle for spontaneous feeling. Perloff laments that today the word *poetry* typically designates “not the melopoetic origins of lyric poetry or the page designs of visual prosody but rather an ironized narrative or, more frequently, the personal expression of a particular insight” (31).<!--Her objection is not to expression as such, but to the way it is often taken to justify a paucity of formal rigor – as if the best language for expressing oneself were also the most transparent. If this argument runs the risk of scapegoating the lyric (especially now that the fervor of the poetry wars is swiftly on the decline), Perloff is quick to emphasize that what is at stake is not the lyric/avant-garde divide, but the fact that the concept of form inherent to both appears to be endangered.[^lyric/avant-garde]--> What the Oulipo offers contemporary poetry – amid the play of homophones and lipograms, amid all the pantoums, rondeux, and villanelles – is a renewed sense of the value of form. From this perspective, constraint-based writing shares a common imperative with modernism: by foregrounding the materiality of poetic language, texts such as *Eunoia* revive the avant-garde (and Russian Formalist) project of estranging us from our naturalized habits of perception, starting with our perception of the graphic and phonetic materiality of language.

Perloff mounts a powerful defense of potential literature that side-steps the charge of gimmickry by linking the work of constraint to a modernist paradigm whose literary value is difficult to deny. On the other hand, she does so by privileging the verbal originality of such works, even though (as she observes herself in *Unoriginal Genius*) this is precisely what contemporary procedural writing calls into question. By his own account, Bök is a founding member of the conceptual writing movement – and *Eunoia* is a definitively conceptual text, part of a genre that champions boredom, disdains originality, and resists close reading (or even reading at all). In Kenneth Goldsmith’s words, such poetry aims to procure a “thinkership” rather than a “readership.” It is strategically illegible – not because the language itself is disjunctive, paratactic, or otherwise difficult in the sense that Ezra Pound’s *Cantos*, Zukofsky’s *“A,”* or the work of the Language poets is difficult, but because the texts are unbearably tedious and boring to read.[^conceptualism-vs-modernism] Such texts invert the relation between linguistic difficulty and literary value that is integral to formalist criticism: if they are difficult, it is because their language appears so quotidian, so bereft of verbal texture; if they are valuable as works of poetry, it is because they appear so profoundly unpoetic. Either these works are written in everyday prose lifted wholesale from unremarkable sources (such as Goldsmith’s *Day*, which transcribes the entirety of a random edition of the *The New York Times* into a *Ulysses*-sized tome) or they follow an axiomatic procedure that renders the text uniform, mechanical, and repetitive (such as Craig Dworkin’s *Parse*, which parses a Victorian grammar manual according to its own rules). Sianne Ngai argues that these conceptual works evoke the affect she dubs “stuplimity”: the sublime power of tedium to stupefy its audience – achieved either via a “minimalist lexicon” deprived of the causal links that would otherwise propel the work forward or via or “a strategy of agglutination – the mass adhesion or coagulation of data particles or signifying units” (262). *Eunoia* is agglutinative in this sense, a fitting example of what Ngai calls “the kind of exhaustion involved in the attempt to read a dictionary.” (Bök, in fact, read the 1976 edition of Webster’s *Third International Dictionary* five times while mining vocabulary for the book.) The result, some might say, is as tedious to read as it must have been to write: an anonymous poster on the *Harriet* blog describes the experience of reading the book as “somewhat akin to reading all the cryptic-crossword clues from the Daily Telegraph for a year.” Like Starnino’s dismissal of *Eunoia* as “pointless toil,” however, such an account overlooks the fact that toil is all to the point: what makes *Eunoia* a conceptual work (and arguably distinguishes the text from its Oulipian precursors) is the pervasive tactics of tedium that characterize both the mode of its composition and its literary effect. From this perspective, *Eunoia* is not simply defendable on the grounds that it rewards close reading – even if, in the hands of a critic as astute as Perloff – it can indeed be close read. To cite the book’s final epigram (from Darren Wershler-Henry): “[t]he tedium is the message” (103).

Part of the problem is that such tedium often takes the form of a rigid uniformity that makes the book seem retrograde or even authoritarian, a critique often leveled at the Oulipo in general. Potential literature, as Jan Baetens and Jean-Jacques Poucel observe, has often been maligned as the work of an *arrière-garde* that rejects the avant-garde’s equation of “innovation as freedom and freedom as innovation”– a nostalgic *retour* borne out of what Paul Valéry would call “sympathy for the return to order” (620). But which order, precisely? Jean-François Puff argues that the Oulipo’s passion for reviving and reinventing *formes fixées* threatens to reabsorb the avant-garde within what Jacques Rancière calls the “representational regime of the arts.” Originating with Aristotle’s *Poetics* and finding its fullest expression from the Renaissance to the end of the eighteenth century (without concluding there), the representational regime defines the fine arts primarily as ways of imitating action, ways of narrating or legislating forms of doing and making (*manière à faire*). The logic of representation is hierarchical, organizing and classifying the arts according to constitutive conventions: the fitness of genre to subject matter, the primacy of living speech over pictorial representation, the causal logic of fictive action (as opposed to the contingent sequence of historical facts), and a close alliance between social standing and rhetorical eloquence – all of which work to establish a hierarchy of artistic forms analogous to the social hierarchy of occupations. With the rise of European romanticism, the representative regime gradually gives way to (without being totally eclipsed by) the aesthetic regime of art, which works to dissolve classical hierarchies by defining art as the “sensible fabric and intelligible form” of a specific mode of experience – a capacity for affection rather than a mimesis of action (*Aisthesis* ix). Even as the aesthetic regime delimits art as an autonomous sphere, collapsing the hierarchy of *manière à faire*, it also makes this new autonomy precarious by erasing the distinction between art and life, making art an experience common to all. For Puff, then, what is at stake in the Oulipo’s nostalgia for order is precisely the tension between these competing regimes of art, between *mimesis* and *aisthesis*. The problem is not just that the group has a strong predilection for perversely restrictive poetic genres that happen to have originated in the classical age or the baroque – or even that, by reviving pantoums, acrostics, or villanelles, the group succumbs to nostalgia for the courtly elegance of the ancient régime. The problem is that the Oulipo identifies art with a set of rules rather than with a mode of experience and, in this way, threatens to reverse the political force of the aesthetic regime: its emancipation of art (and of its spectators) from the hierarchical logic of representation.

In many ways, *Eunoia* is an exemplar of such logic. Bök has said that the project “reflects a kind of neoclassical set of values about beautiful thinking.” The book’s epigram is taken from *The Triumphs of Temper* (1781) by William Hayley (the friend and biographer of William Cowper): “*Source of my being and my life’s support*! / [eunoia]{.smallcaps} call’d in this celestial Court” (9). *Eunoia* bears out the courtly decorum of this heroic couplet on several fronts: there is the lipogram itself, of course; the restaging of classical genres with a drollness characteristic of the mock epic (Chapter E shows all the refinement of Alexander Pope’s translation of the *Iliad*, if not also the witticism of “The Rape of the Lock”); the allegorical flatness of the characters; the simple causal logic of a plot composed primarily of short transitive sentences (enforced partly by the absence of available prepositions); the use of Rabelaisian catalogues. Even the design of the book is decidedly classical: Bök constructed the layout himself and typeset the text in Adobe Minion (a humanist typeface based on several old-style typefaces of the late Renaissance and now a mainstay of academic monographs – you are reading it now). Indeed, the design is another unstated constraint: each chapter has the exact same number of lines throughout (12 for *o* and *a*; 11 for *i* and *e*; 13 for *u*) and the text fits squarely into a right-justified block with minimal hyphenation and no rivers or text-wraps from page to page. This is a nontrivial feat: Bök had to truncate his writing to fit the page, typesetting as he wrote and discarding otherwise viable lines because they were too long or too short. The effect of this Procrustean treatment is a rigorously uniform design that compliments the lipogram’s power to marshal language into order.

And yet Bök also characterizes this pursuit of order as a form of self-directed play. He describes the writing of *Eunoia* (and of avant-garde poetry in general) as an activity “done for its own sake – as a kind of hedonistic enjoyment of language, language free from the need to mean … That’s what going on in *Eunoia*: language has taken a little holiday from the dictionary” (“On Being Stubborn”). Echoing Gregory Bateson’s definition of information, Bök argues that the poet’s task is to “produce a minimal difference that, in fact, makes a difference.” On the one hand, then, he anticipates Perloff’s argument (derived ultimately from Russian Formalism and Jakobson’s structural linguistics) that poetry diverts language from its communicative function in order to render it newly palpable, to demystify the relation between its naturalized capacity to convey thought and its basis in a differential system of arbitrary signs. Such demystification, moreover, is aligned with the avant-garde’s critique of mimesis: to reject poetry’s illusion of transcendental meaning (by analogy with painting’s impression of depth via the illusion of linear perspective) is to reclaim the surface of language as poetry’s proper medium.

On the other hand, Bök’s remark invokes a competing theory of the avant-garde under the sign of Theophile Gautier’s dictum *l’art pour l’art*, a vestige of the post-Kantian aesthetic tradition and its concept of art as a sphere of disinterested, self-directed play. This is how I read Bök’s claim that his practice involves “a kind of hedonistic enjoyment,” a recognition that avant-garde poetry stages its break with past forms on behalf of the disruptive force of the aesthetic. Responding to Starnino’s review – and specifically to its invocation of Johnson and Coleridge to defend the romantic concept of organic form – Bök sets out to “rebut these critics by citing the contrary argument of Kant, their peer, who suggests that forms are beautiful, only if they exist for their own sake, divorced from any reference to a superior function” (“Nude Formalism”). Leaving aside the complicated question of Coleridge’s interpretation of Kant (whom Starnino clearly misreads, ascribing to him the opinion that form must be an *instrument* of thought), I want to underscore Bök’s more general point that constraint-based poetry is a form of aesthetic play – a point he makes at greater length in his doctoral thesis on Alfred Jarry and the imaginary science of ’pataphysics.

Perhaps best known for his proto-absurdist play Ubu Roi (whose *enfant terrible* also stars in Chapter U of *Eunoia*) and a major influence on futurism and surrealism, Jarry is also the author of a cryptic work of speculative fiction whose protagonist, Dr. Faustroll, proclaims the birth of a new science:

> [P]ataphysics will be, above all, the science of the particular … It will investigate the laws that govern exceptions, and it will explain the universe supplementary to this one; or, less ambitiously, it will describe a universe that one might envision – and that perhaps one *should* envision – in place of the traditional one. (30 – 31)

Bök’s study traces the afterlife of this enigmatic definition in post-structuralist theory (Deleuze, Baudrillard, and Seres, among others) and across a surprising range of avant-garde writers and artists: the Oulipians, of course, but also Jorge Luis Borges and Marcel Duchamp (who joined the *Collège de ’Pataphysique* in the 1950s). ’Pataphysics imitates scientific procedures while strategically refusing to yield calculable results: the task of the ’pataphysician is to posit absurd hypotheses that can be tested with systemic rigor and yet whose solution produces no positive knowledge. Consider, for example, Duchamp’s notes for *Boîte verte*, proposing to “classify combs by the number of their teeth.” Or his *Trois stoppages étalon*, a work composed by dropping three meter-long strings onto the ground and using their resultant shapes as blueprints for machine-cut rulers. Since each ruler has a curved extension of exactly one meter but a different linear extension, it is both perfectly exact and completely useless for measuring actual objects. Bök describes such practices as radically speculative: ’pataphysics makes hypotheses not in order to prove their validity, but in order to envision an imaginary solution to a problem that was never posed. The logical sequence from hypothesis to proof, from the operative *as if* to the conditional *if then*, is short-circuited, instead giving rise to a virtual space between quantitative rigor and aesthetic play. If science, Bök argues, is “allotelic … justifying itself for the sake of a finality outside its own language,” then poetry (and the aesthetic  imagination more generally) is “autotelic … justifying itself for the sake of a finality inside its own language” (15). The task of ’pataphysics is to deconstruct this symmetry: to make science a space of self-directed play (relieved of its monopoly on the production of truth) and poetry a process of rigorous inquiry. ’Pataphysics, then, is also an aesthetic praxis that suspends the demand for meaningful action in order to create literary and artistic works that are disinterested, purposive (without purpose), and resistant to conceptualization even as they offer the semblance of conceptual thought.[^kaufman]

Starnino’s dismissal of Eunoia as a literary game “upheld for its own sake” (134), then, overlooks the way that the post-romantic lyric tradition, like Bök himself, champions poetry precisely for its resistance to instrumentalization. Craig Dworkin describes Eunoia as “an interface to the database of entries in the three volumes of the 1967 edition of Webster’s *Third International Dictionary*” (52). But this interface is anything but user friendly. It is designed, rather, to strategically dismantle the dictionary’s effort to order and taxonomize the English language. Although the words contained in its lexicon form a complete set delimited by the constraint (every word, or almost every word, that uses only a single vowel), those words are neither defined nor available for random access. What is more, because the lipogram excludes so many common words, Bök must dredge up terms whose specificity belies their context: a poet is not just a poet, but “[a] Dada bard as daft as Tzara,” “[a] madcap vandal,” or “a pagan skald” (12). Such lexemes index the absence of the common terms they replace while at the same time giving rise to a surfeit of meaning. In this way, the text inverts the relation between the specific and the general, between hyponoym and hypernym, that makes dictionary definition possible in the first place. The uniform logic of hierarchical definition is broken; the dictionary dissolves into a chaotic welter of examples all competing for equal attention. Umberto Eco describes this effect in an essay on the Porphyrian tree that might easily apply to *Eunoia*:

> The tree of genera and species, the tree of substances, blows up in a dust of differentiae, in a turmoil of infinite accidents, in a nonhierarchical network of *qualia*. The dictionary is dissolved into a potentially unordered and unrestricted galaxy of pieces of world knowledge. The dictionary thus becomes an encyclopedia, because it was in fact *a disguised encyclopedia*. [-@eco86 68]

As an interface to the dictionary, *Eunoia* is strategically useless, but useless in a way that also mimics (and thereby reveals as contradictory) the dictionary’s desire to systematize knowledge. The book claims to reveal statistical trends in English usage, which it does in part (the fact that words for food, sex, nature, and travel occur with such high frequency in the language that one can write at length about these topoi using only one vowel). But at the same time, the logic of statistical organization is everywhere subverted by what Dworkin (after Jarry) calls “the perverse spin of the expected” (31): witticisms, tautologies, double entendres (to say nothing of Ubu’s scatological humor) – all of which signify more than the dictionary bargains for. *Eunoia* thus showcases the limits of statistical metrics by parodying their effort to form coherent totalities. The book demonstrates, in Dworkin’s words, “the ‘pataphysical power of exceptions – singularities, anomalies, perversions, swerves – to belie the ambitions of any general system of statistical average” (39).

*Eunoia* refuses to deliver calculable results even as it makes the logic of calculation into a form of play, an image of lyric repose staged within and against the lipogram whose ardor it negates. For a text so obsessed with toil (and especially the toil of its own composition), *Eunoia* is surprisingly full of leisure: of the four repeated genres (banquet, debauch, tableux, voyage), at least three are pastimes,<!--(or all four, if the voyage counts as a cruise)--> which the poem elaborates with gusto: Helen of Troy, for example, enjoys a feast no less sumptuous and ethereal than the infamous *blancmanche* stanza of Keats’s “Eve of St. Agnes”: “[H]er serfs get the best gels ever jelled; *les pêches gelées* – blended sherbet, served fresh. The scented desert smells even sweeter when served ere the sweetness melts” (35).[^blancmange] Such moments of *otium* are most vivid and emphatic when they appear, as they often do, in the final line of each page, suspended in the empty space between pages even as they offer the semblance of closure. This happens most often in Chapter A, perhaps because the indefinite article is best suited to the presentation of singular objects:

> A naphtha lamp can give a calm warmth. (13)

> A lass as sad as a swan twangs a glass harp. (15)

> A clasp snaps apart, and a scant shawl falls. (16)

> A damp flag flaps at half mast. (25)

Other such lyric suspensions abound. Chapter O is lit with “glowworms” (like Marvell’s “ye living lamps”) that glow like “[d]ots of color, blown off from blowtorch glow” (75). Chapter E is ephemeral, partly thanks to all the nouns that end in *ness (feebleness, helplessness, wretchedness, dejectedness*): nominalized adjectives that give feelings the fleeting solidity of things. In Chapter I, the most lyrical of all, the poet muses: “I sight high cliffs, rising, indistinct in thick mists, lit with lightning” (53). Or he surveys Tintern Abbey with Wordsworth (who also makes a cameo in Chapter O): “Hiking in British districts, I picnic in virgin firths, grinning in mirth with misfit whims, smiling if I find birch twigs, smirking if I find mint sprigs” (52). Such images of idleness – which offer a fleeting respite from the onslaught of the dictionary – remind us that the constraint itself is a way of suspending the demand for profitable work. They are at once artful and effortless, the result of an exacting procedure whose goal is to make us forget the presence of the lipogram that the text also flaunts. In this way, *Eunoia* thematizes its own reception as an artwork whose appreciation invites disinterested reflection.

Nowhere is this more clear than in the deaths that conclude each chapter. We have already witnessed how Hassan dies: “alas, alack: a shah has a grand mal spasm and, *ahh*, gasps a schwa, as a last gasp” (30). But if that gasp recalls Olga’s fatal cry of “Maldiction!” in Perec’s *La Disparition* – marked by the impossibility of uttering the vowel that kills her – it also recalls an ekphrastic tradition that associates the stillness of death with the breathless awe proper to the contemplation of works of art.[^holiday] On the one hand, Hassan’s death parodies the trope of ekphrastic reverence: to witness an “asthma attack” whose victim “barfs and farts” as he expires is both unglamorous and sadistically funny. But the image still enjoys a certain kind of awe (albeit vicariously) by suggesting that we should indeed catch our breath, if not at the solemnity of death, then at the virtuosity of the parody. Helen’s death is only hinted at (even if, *pace* Homer, she survives the fall of Troy): Chapter E ends simply “*elle régne éternellement*,” but as with Chapter A, her passage from life to death is partly ekphrastic. Painted images gradually eclipse her living person: “When Vermeer sketches *les belles femmes de Delft*, he remembers Helen … When the sketchers (Erté, Ernst, Klee, Léger – even Bellmer) render *les événements des rêves*, these esthetes get felt pens, then sketch her presence” (49). That presence, moreover, inspires awe of the kind we usually feel for art: “Men see her elven slenderness, then pledge themselves her serfs.” Chapter U, lewd and irreverent almost to the bitter end, relents in its final line with the elegiac image of a shipwreck: “[G]ulfs crush us, *gulp*, dunk us – burst lungs succumb” (81). Like Eliot’s “Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock,” whose final stanza turns from its speaker’s self-obsessed doubt to an anonymous *we* who spontaneously perish in the sea (“[t]ill human voices wake us, and we drown”), Chapter U ends by abandoning the absurdist escapades of Jarry’s Ubu in order to posit a community of readers united by the image of their mutual death. *Eunoia* thus forms a kind of loop – from Hassan’s “last gasp” to Ubu’s “burst lungs” – that prompts our own response to the work: the hush of reverence, perhaps, or the author’s sigh of exhaustion.

Exhaustion – but not resignation. The last gasp of *Eunoia* is more akin to what John Barth, writing of Borges’s story “Pierre Menard,” calls “an image of exhaustion” (73): the feeling that literature has exhausted its potential, which itself is a powerful literary trope capable of overcoming the exhaustion it describes. The imaginary solution that Bök invents is to write a book that figures its own composition as a process of crushing fatigue, one that thwarts any desire to recuperate fatigue as a byproduct of meaningful work. But the tedium of *Eunoia* emerges not only from Bök’s own narration of his Sisphyean labor, but also from within the seemingly affectless, cerebral system that the book itself constructs. Like other works of Oulipian and conceptual poetry, *Eunoia* displays what Eve Meltzer (writing of conceptual art) calls “affective investment in disaffected mastery” (14): the pleasure or displeasure we take in Bök’s effort to wrangle language into an idea of order (an effort, as we have seen, that is programmed to fail) becomes part of the work’s constitutive tension between procedural rigor and affective texture. In this way, *Eunoia* falls short of reinscribing the lyric/avant-garde divide on which conceptualism stakes its polemic, refusing any simple antagonism between, on the one hand, post-romantic conceptions of poetry as a space of imaginative free play and, on the other, avant-garde and poststructuralist efforts to equate the poetic as such with the inhuman materiality of language. It is through Bök’s rigidly impersonal procedure that the aesthetic and affective dimension of the text emerges, a dimension that shares with lyric poetry a strategic neglect of purpose. If the Oulipo are too often accused of forsaking the emancipatory power of art for crossword puzzles and language games, *Eunoia* stands as a poignant reminder that aesthetic play and the emergent play of constrained systems are not principally opposed: in Bök’s words, the lipogram dons its straight-jacket in order to allow language, released from the injunction to mean, to “express an uncanny, if not sublime, thought” (103).

[^eunoia-adaptations]: Denise Fujiwara and her ensemble premiered their dance adaptation of *Eunoia* at the Harbourfront Centre in Toronto on March 2014. Among other constraints, the dancers were required to “initiate movement from body parts that contain only the appropriate vowel: for example in Chapter E, from the neck, knee, temple, and spleen” (Fujiwara). The hiphop group Eek the Alien remixed sentences from Chapter I for the track “Nihil Dicit” on their album *The Paranoia Within*. Leslie Ahenda tweeted an emoji translation of the first page of *Eunoia* on 18 Feb. 2016.

[^against-conceptualism]: For a recent example, see Calvin Bedient’s aptly-named polemic in the *Boston Review*: “Against Conceptualism: Defending the Poetry of Affect.” Bedient targets *Eunoia* as an especially disaffected example of conceptualism’s rejection of the lyric:

    > What is the politics implicit in Oulipian writing, if any? I ask it, first, of Christian Bök’s popular *Eunoia* (2001), narrative poetry in the improbable form of a lipogrammic fantasia on the vowels, each one marched in order in its five chapters, each word conscripted for its contribution to the vowel of the moment. Fans of the poem like to discover profundities in it, but I find it clichéd and shallow. It replaces André Breton’s directive, revolt so as to be adequate to oneself, with the message: be as ingenious as you can. Delight in the auto-affection of your faculties.
    
[^queneau-sonnets]: Queneau’s *Poèmes*, often cited as the inaugural text of the Oulipo, consists of ten fourteen-line sonnets whose lines are interchangeable: any line can replace the corresponding line of another sonnet while preserving the rhyme scheme and the laws of syntax. The text is a machine for generating sonnets: 100 000 000 000 000 (or 10^14^) sonnets, to be exact. Queneau calculates that it would take 190 258 751 years to read the work in its entirety, reading one sonnet a minute, all day long, every day of the year [-@queneau-poèmes-translation p. 14].

[^war-music]: Bök also happens to be a fan of *War Music*, Christopher Logue’s modernized retelling of the *Iliad*, which was shortlisted for the Griffin Poetry Prize the same year *Eunoia* won.

[^lipogram]: Chapter E is also a nod to the classical origins of the lipogram: in late antiquity, the Greek poet Nestor of Laranda composed an *Iliad* in twenty-four books, each of which omitted a subsequent letter of the Greek alphabet. Tryphiodorus of Sicily did the same for the *Odyssey*. See Perec,“History of the Lipogram.”

[^xenotext-reading]: Bök, Christian. Poetry reading. Pages Bookstore, Calgary, AB. 22 Aug. 2014. The published version of the translation appears in *The Xenotext: Book 1*.

[^nitpicking]: Bök anticipates these scruples within the text itself, which uncannily rebukes its future critics: “I fit childish insights within rigid limits, writing shtick which might instill priggish misgivings in critics blind with hindsight. I dismiss nitpicking criticism which flirts with philistinism” (50).

<!---[^lyric/avant-garde]: For examples of recent efforts to move beyond the lyric/avant-garde divide, see Izenberg, *Being Numerous*; Jennifer Ashton, “Poetry of the Twenty-First Century”; Rei Terada, “After the Critique of Lyric”; and Perloff ’s own essay, “Towards a Conceptual Lyric.”-->

[^conceptualism-vs-modernism]: See, for example, Goldsmith’s introduction to a special issue of *Poetry* magazine on Flarf and conceptual writing:

    > Start making sense. Disjunction is dead. The fragment, which ruled poetry for the past one hundred years, has left the building. Subjectivity, emotion, the body, and desire, as expressed in whole units of plain English with normative syntax, has returned ... Why atomize, shatter, and splay language into nonsensical shards when you can hoard, store, mold, squeeze, shovel, soil, scrub, package, and cram the stuff into towers of words and castles of language with a stroke of the keyboard? (“Flarf ”)

    The idea that contemporary avant-garde poetry is turning away from modernist disjunction is widespread, and not only among conceptual poets. Compare Tan Lin’s call for “a softer, ambient avant-garde that works against radical disjuncture” and instead explores work that is “relaxing, boring, absorptive, sampled freely and without effort” (“Interview”).

    Bök, for his part, sees this shift away from disjunction as one of scale – from relatively visible linguistic units (letters, words, syllables) – to the inhuman abstraction of the Word .doc or the BitTorrent file. Unlike Goldsmith, however, he remains skeptical of efforts to break with the historic avant-gardes: see, for example, his critique of Reginald Shepherd’s concept of “post-avant poetry” in a blogpost for *Harriet* (“Late Past the Post”).

[^kaufman]: Bök is hardly alone in casting his avant-garde poetics in Kantian language. As Robert Kaufman persuasively argues, the Third *Critique* (partly by way of Adorno’s unorthodox reading of Kant in *Aesthetic Theory*) underwrites a wide swath of modern poetry and poetics – from Baudelaire’s *Les fleurs du mal* to the work of the Language poets. Poetry is aesthetic, for Kaufman, in its desire to stretch language towards “affect and song,” making available a kind of “quasi-conceptuality” and yielding an experience of concepts that have yet to be determined or realized. If, as Adorno writes in “Lyric and Society,” the lyric is a form in which “language acquires a voice [die Sprache selber laut wird]” (56), this is not because language usurps the subject by revealing its artifice, but because the lyric, by making language musical, restores its lost suppleness as a medium for thought. For a fuller account of the connection between avant-garde poetry and the Third *Critique*, see Kaufman’s essays “Negatively Capable Dialectics: Keats, Vendler, Adorno, and the Theory of the Avant-Garde,” “Everybody Hates Kant: Blakean Formalism and the Symmetries of Laura Moriarty,” and “Lyric’s Expression: Musicality, Conceptuality, Critical Agency.”

[^blancmange]: Marjorie Perloff briefly makes this connection in “The Oulipo Factor,” describing “The Eve of St. Agnes” as “a poem that, like *Eunoia*, dramatizes the inextricability of pain and pleasure” (38). For a reading of the specifically gastronomic pleasure of that poem (or what Timothy Morton calls “the blancmange effect” of Stanza 30) see Morton, *The Poetics of Spice*, 148 – 170.

[^holiday]: One oft-cited example (exemplary, no doubt, because it can also be read as parodic) is Frank O’Hara’s “The Day Lady Died,” which ends just as Billy Holiday “whispered a song along the keyboard / to Mal Waldron and everyone and I stopped breathing” (28 – 9).
