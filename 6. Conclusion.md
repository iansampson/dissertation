# Conclusion

A food diary, a game of chess, a monovocalic lipogram, a list of Dante translations, a palimpsest of Shakespeare’s Sonnets. One of the implicit arguments of this dissertation is that such pithy reductions fail to capture the texture of the works they epitomize. Although conceptual poetry is often framed as a genre that trades reading for thinking, reducing the poetic text from an aesthetic object to a transmissible concept, a close reading of the works in question reveals an irreducible gap between this concept and the fabric of the text itself, between the intelligible and the legible, which no paraphrase can gloss over without remainder. The polemic distinction between thinkership and readership that fuels conceptual poetry and its inheritance of the Oulipian art of *écriture sous contrainte* seems caught in a hermeneutic circle: if poets and critics assume that writing of this sort is too banal, too featureless, too *boring* to deserve sustained attention, they filter out all evidence to the contrary, which only close reading, foreclosed at the outset, can reveal. Only by *reading* Perec’s gargantuan catalogue of food and drink, for example, and refusing to equate the text with the procedure described in its title, can we discern the hidden redundancies and omissions that separate the work of an embodied and fallible author from the output of a thinking machine. At the same time, these swerves or errors (from *errare*, to stray) only become legible against the backdrop of the abstraction they disrupt: to read against the grain of a constraint (and to reveal the granularity of the text it encodes) is to keep both the constraint itself and its deviations in focus. In this way, the method I have followed in this dissertation also grounds its principle argument: that poetry written under constraint responds to the logic of new media not just by imitating its binary structures and bitwise operations, but also by revealing its underlying contingency, the detours and digressions that no algorithm can account for. To trace such deviancy requires sustained attention (a resource that new media seem especially keen to exhaust). It is no accident that many of these works accompany scenes of extended reading: Bök reading the dictionary, Bergvall reading Dante translations, Bervin reading Shakespeare. If these practices index a broader shift from intensive to extensive forms of reading, or from “deep attention” to “hyper attention” (Hayles, “Attention” 1), ingesting whole books or even collections of books rather than exemplary passages, they continue to invite readers to attend to moments when the motor of summation breaks down, when an incongruous detail interrupts the routine and calls for renewed vigilance.

In this sense, my argument goes beyond existing work on conceptual poetry by suggesting that the practice of lyric reading, with its keen attentiveness to prosodic form and its nuanced theory of the individual voice, is far from obsolete in the digital age, offering a powerful mode of resistance to the logic of new media. It is a critical commonplace to oppose the conceptual and the lyrical: on the subject of Craig Dworkin’s *Parse*, for example, which parses Edwin Abbott Abbott’s 1883 grammar manual *How to Parse* according to its own rules, Brian Reed argues that the text “locates possibilities for freedom not in passages of lyrical imaginative virtuosity (which prove one’s mastery of a vocation) but in passages of breakdown and incapacity (which reveal the inhumanity of the demands placed on ‘knowledge workers’ by today’s information-based economy)” (xv). Although I agree with Reed and others that the emancipatory potential of conceptual poetry unfolds within such moments of radical incapacity, I disagree that this disruption is solely a matter of revelation or exposure, where poetry becomes a symptom of the logic it serves to critique. On the contrary, the works gathered here explore a multitude of ways to tarry with and dwell within this hyper-industrial epoch without reducing poetry to just another form of knowledge work. By the same token, these works are hardly devoid of virtuosity, affect, or, for that matter, lyricism: the critical commonplace that conceptual poetry is fundamentally anti-lyrical or even anti-aesthetic (which is to say, inimical to the rhetorical and imaginative texture that distinguishes lyric poetry from, say, the merely informative language of a dictionary or a newspaper) rests upon a reductive definition of the lyric as a genre solely devoted to personal expression. My readings challenge the assumption that constraints are always impersonal (even when, as with  *Eunoia*, a refined sense of impersonality itself acquires an affective charge) and that the lyric aspires only to “imaginative virtuosity” and vocational mastery, privileging the coherence and continuity of the lyric voice rather than the sort of “breakdown” that unfolds when avant-garde poets push their medium to its limits. If nothing else, my readings of Bergvall and Bervin testify to a mode of lyric reading where failure, omission, and loss (with all of their elegiac overtones) emerge in tandem with the errors and glitches that afflict inscriptive media, where the lyric voice embodies (and relentlessly laments) its own need for technical reproduction: “I am / vanishing or vanished / in these black lines” [@bervin08 63]. Although such lyrical forms of reticular action emerge most clearly in my readings of contemporary poetry, they also resonate with the ways in which Perec and Calvino, two decades earlier, explore other modes of inoperativity that arise in and through mechanical constraints. Among the many parallels between Bergvall’s list of Dante translations and Perec’s list of food and drink, the most important, perhaps, is their resistance to chronology, their refusal to progress: although Perec records a year of his life (an interval, or “spatial cut,” as Bergvall describes the durational poetics of *L’infra-ordinaire* [“Constraint” 44]), the text is both temporally and logically disordered, arranged by an error-riddled and often whimsical taxonomy. Incapacity, it turns out, is a deeply lyrical trope, and the moments of impasse, hesitancy, and reticence that punctuate these works are hardly evidence, as other critics have suggested, for the obsolescence of the individual voice in the information age. Rather, they reveal an ethos of inconsequence at the heart of new media that offers the lyric self some reprieve from the contemporary demand that we log, publish, and compute even the most trivial details of our daily lives. Within the interstices of digital logic, there is still room for anomalies and deviations that suspend, if only for a moment, the onward march of timelines and feeds. And while this deviancy provides much-needed fuel for critique, revealing the fault-lines of systems that have little tolerance for error, it also offers tools for repair, showing how precarious selves might endure in a world that threatens to automate and optimize our every footfall. To give pause, to digress, to double back: these are the tactics of a new media lyric that sidesteps the codification of the personal by embracing a different sort of code, a constraint that accommodates the writing of the self by leaving room for imperfection, for the profound sense of indeterminacy and play that gives potential literature its name.
