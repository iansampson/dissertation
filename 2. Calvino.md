# The Sovereign Grid: Italo Calvino’s *Invisible Cities*

In *Six Memos for the Next Millenium*, a series composed for the 1985 Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard, Italo Calvino speculates how literature – or the literary codex, already an embattled medium at the time – might endure in a world increasingly saturated with information. If literature has a future, he suggests, that is because it already embodies many of the qualities that define new media – and which form the five topoi of the lectures: lightness, quickness, exactitude, visibility, and multiplicity. These qualities overlap: to the degree that Calvino’s writing – like that of his colleagues among the Oulipo – aspires to the exactitude of mathematics, his style tends to be concise (and therefore quick to reach its point) and abstract, unburdened by historical circumstance or referential texture. Lightness, even more than speed for Calvino, is also the force that governs computation:

> È vero che il software non potrebbe esercitare i poteri della sua leggerezza se non mediante la pesantezza del hardware; ma è il software che commanda, che agisce sul mondo esterno e sulle macchine le quali esistono solo in funzione del software, si evolvono in modo d’elaborare programmi sempre più complessi. La seconda rivoluzione industriale non si presenta come la prima con immagini schiaccianti quali presse di laminatoi o colate d’acciaio, ma come i bits d’un flusso d’informazione che corre sui circuiti sotto forma d’impulsi elettronici. Le macchine di ferro ci sono sempre, ma obbediscono ai bits senza peso. (10)

> It’s true that software cannot exert the power of its lightness except through the heaviness of hardware, but it’s software that’s in command, acting on the outside world and on machines that exist solely as functions of their software, evolving in order to run programs that are ever more complex. The second industrial revolution doesn’t present itself, as the first did, with overwhelming images of rolling mills or molten steel, but as bits in a stream of information that flows, as electronic impulses, through circuits. There are still machines of iron, but they obey bits without weight. [^calvino-translations]

Calvino anticipates contemporary theories of new media as a “sovereignty of data,” a regime, as Tung-Hui Hu defines it, that “blurs the distinction between the regulatory protocols of data networks and the sovereign’s right to kill” [-@hu15 139].[^new-media-sovereignty] The Italian text makes the analogy more forcefully: it is software that *commands* (“è il software che commanda”) and hardware, for all its heft, must *obey*. Software is light because, like all binary data, it exists beyond the confines of any particular medium: every application – after its source code is compiled into an executable binary (a process that itself follows a sovereign logic, as Wendy Chun observes) – can move seamlessly from machine to machine, from medium to medium. Software passes essentially unchanged (as it does every time a user downloads an app) from a magnetic drive in a server farm, through a vast network of fiberoptic cables, over a wifi signal, and finally onto the flash drive of a mobile phone. With the future of networked computing already on the horizon, Calvino discerns a connection between the immateriality of software, composed of weightless bits (“bits senza peso”), and its demand for absolute obedience, its power to command the most formidable of machines. He goes on to relate the lightness of the digital to that of literature – or rather, potential literature, whose constraints, like the axioms and theorems that drive computational logic, make it fluid and swift enough to carve a path through “the dense network of public and private restrictions” that envelops contemporary life. Potential literature is “a literature as the extraction of its own square root,” a genre that “dreams of immense cosmologies, sagas, and epics encapsulated in the dimensions of an epigram” (50). The abstraction inherent in such epigrammatic writing is what ensures its staying power in the digital age: only through “the highest concentration of poetry and thought,” as if shrinking itself to fit the storage capacity of a microchip, will literature survive “in the ever more congested times that await us” (50).

Later in the lectures, exemplifying the exactitude promised by this computational turn, Calvino cites a passage from *Invisible Cities* in which Kublai Khan attempts to map his empire onto the surface of a chessboard.[^chessboard-novel] A Cartesian grid whose sixty-four squares align with the book’s sixty-four chapters, the chessboard is a fitting analogy for the “geometric rationalism” embodied by the emperor and his desire to reduce the “tangle” of urban life to a governable structure of lines and points [^tangle]. It is the chessboard that prompts Kublai to envision his empire as “a desert of labile and interchangeable data, like grains of sand, from which there appeared, for each city and province, the figures evoked by the Venetian’s logographs” (22). Chess is a medium that allows the two characters to establish “a different communication”: when Polo arrives at the court “totally ignorant of the Levantine languages,” he expresses himself “with objects he took from his knapsacks – ostrich plumes, peashooters, quartzes – which he arranged in front of him like chessmen” (21). At first blush, this strained effort to communicate with objects (“a helmet, a seashell, a coconut, a fan” [121]) evokes a sort of nostalgia for the lost immediacy of things – an allusion, perhaps, to the professors at Jonathan Swift’s Academy of Lagado, who carry enormous sacks containing every possible object they might need to name.[^zany] But Polo communicates less by moving objects across the chessboard than by moving his own body: when he first arrives at the court, he can “express himself only with gestures, leaps, cries of wonder and of horror, animal barkings or hootings” (21). It is his “improvised pantomimes” that the khan must “interpret” and “decipher”: a city depicted by “the leap of a fish escaping the cormorant’s beak” or “a naked man [*l’uomo nudo*] running through fire unscorched” (21). A comically excessive display of affect that animates and enlivens the body, these gestures also encipher the body into an instrument of semiosis: speech is stripped away, but rather than returning to a naïve or prelinguistic sense of completeness, Polo performs – at the command of his sovereign – a form of nude life from which the dignity and polity imparted by speech has been subtracted.

What Calvino calls “a language without a speaking subject,” then, undergoes a grotesque inversion in *Invisible Cities*. Rather than allow gestures to signify the continuity of a world that has yet to be discretized by alphabetic writing (as Swift does), the text codifies the gesturing body itself into the differential logic of the grid. Calvino stages a crisis analogous to the one that Bernard Stiegler (after Jacques Derrida) ascribes to the invention of alphabetic writing, fracturing an illusory “state of continuity” into “a play of analyzable, diacritical, combinatorial elements” [-@stiegler02 p. 160]. *Invisible Cities* traces this combinatory logic from writing to the cities themselves: the citizens of Zenobia, for instance, imagine a replica of their metropolis that is “perhaps quite different, a-flutter with banners and ribbons, but always derived by combining elements of that first model” (35). The chessboard enacts this combinatory in miniature: an eight-by-eight grid that analyzes even gestures and interjections into a grammar composed of discrete signs. But unlike natural language, where signifiers acquire meaning through shared convention, the language of the chessboard takes on a sovereign force the moment each object is *assigned* an arbitrary referent:

> A ogni pezzo si poteva volta a volta attribuire un significato appropriato: un cavallo poteva rappresentare tanto un vero cavallo quanto un corteo di carrozze, un esercito in marcia, un monumento equestre; e una regina poteva essere una dama affacciata al balcone, una fontana, una chiesa dalla cupola cuspidata, una pianta di mele cotogne. (57)

> To each piece, in turn, they could give an appropriate meaning: a knight could stand for a real horseman, or for a procession of coaches, an army on the march, an equestrian monument: a queen could be a lady looking down from her balcony, a fountain, a church with a pointed dome, a quince tree. (121)

If William Weaver’s translation effaces the semiotic valence of some of these words (*rappresentare*, *significato*) in favor of familiar monosyllables, his crib of *cupola* as *dome* adds another layer of meaning by echoing Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan,” one of Calvino’s models for the book.[^xanadu] Like his romantic namesake (who did “a stately pleasure dome decree” – above “a mighty fountain” and “many an incense-bearing tree” [2-19]), the emperor of *Invisible Cities* decrees his *duomo*, fountain, and quince tree through a speech act that both engenders and replaces the things it names. The sovereign act of naming aligns with the decisive operations permitted by the grid: the connection between signifier and signified is not merely arbitrary but forcibly arbitrated into being. At the same time, the use of passive voice in the Italian (“*si poteva volta a volta attribuire*”: to each piece *could be attributed*) abstracts the source of this power away from the emperor to the game itself (which is played “*volta a volta*,” turn by turn). If the passage draws an analogy between sovereign power and the power of a chess player over the pieces he commands, it also reveals the degree to which the emperor is subject to protocols outside his control. Chess permits little ambiguity: a piece cannot occupy more than one cell at once (by straddling the border between two cells, for example) nor can the game be left suspended between two turns (as any novice discovers who unwittingly lets go of a piece before fully committing to its new position, an action that irrevocably ends the turn). Each piece occupies both an absolute point in the sequence of turns and an absolute position on the grid. These two systems converge in the algebraic notation used to record games (and codified quite strictly by the Fédération Internationale des Échecs), where a step-by-step ledger coordinates the exact coordinates of each piece at any given point in time (“[c]{.smallcaps}5,” for example, signifies a classic opener: a pawn advancing two spaces to the third column of the fifth row). When Kublai compels Polo to contort his body across the surface of a life-sized chessboard, then, he also makes the board a figure for the structures that precede and condition his own authority. If the emperor succeeds in deciphering Polo’s pantomime of cities, it is only because he is himself “an emblem among emblems” (23).

This tension between sovereign power and rigorous protocol comes to a fore at the end of book, when the chessboard allegory reaches its logical conclusion.

> Allo scacco matto, sotto il piede del re sbalzato via dalla mano del vincitore, resta un quadrato nero o bianco. A forza di scorporare le sue conquiste per ridurle all’essenza, Kublai era arrivato all’operazione estrema: la conquista definitiva, di cui i multiformi tesori dell’impero non erano che involucri illusori, si riduceva a un tassello di legno piallato: il nulla... (58)

> At checkmate, beneath the foot of the king, knocked aside by the winner’s hand, a black or a white square remains. By disembodying his conquests to reduce them to the essential, Kublai had arrived at the extreme operation: the definitive conquest, of which the empire’s multiform treasures were only illusory envelopes. It was reduced to a square of planed wood: nothingness... (131)

*Scacco matto*: a synecdoche for regicide. Kublai concludes his meditation on chess with the figurative death of a king. Checkmate “disembod[ies]” him, or rather he arrives at the *essenza* of chess only by force (*a forza*) of his own excorporation. The verb *scorporare* (from ecclesiastical Latin: *(e)xcorporare*, to dissolve a body or uniform substance) carries a legal and economic force in Italian: to expropriate part of a whole in order to redistribute it elsewhere, such as removing land from an inheritance [@scorporare]. In this context, as an antonym of *incorporate*, it recalls the theological doctrine of the king’s two bodies: the emperor embodies a divinely ordained kingship to the extent that his power is excorporated from (and therefore able to outlive) his mortal body. With every checkmate a king dies, and yet the king survives to play another game.

This sovereign afterlife depends in turn upon the differential logic of the chessboard, the “black or white square” on which the king’s chess piece lies toppled and deposed. Kublai arrives at the *ezzenza* of sovereignty by way of an *operazione*, a word that combines military conquest, surgical precision, and algebraic calculation: in chess, the tactics of warfare coincide precisely with formal operations performed on a grid. The operation is “extreme” and “definitive” to the degree that it excludes the possibility of a middle term. Either the white king dies or the black – a binary that describes the outcome not just of a particular game (underscored by the indefinite article: *un quadrato* and not *questo quadrato*), but of every possible game. A multiplicity of conquests inheres in “a square of plain wood”: not a *quadrato*, a shape capable of standing alone, defined by its angles and edges, but a *tassello*, a shape that exists only as part of a pattern, a shape that can *tessellate*, forming a mosaic by repeating itself without overlapping or leaving gaps (as in Escher’s images of chessboards formed from the tessellated silhouettes of birds). The shift from *quadrato* to *tassello* in the passage fortifies the analogy between sovereign force and binary logic: the square on which the “definitive conquest” takes place is itself defined purely by difference, one stitch in a recursive pattern where each element signifies only the absence of its neighbor.

A *tassello* is also a wedge or a plug, with the same technical connotation as in English: a device that draws electricity from a socket. If this plug is capable of powering Kublai’s empire, it is partly because it is a conduit for those weightless bits, as Calvino calls them, that “flow, as electrical impulses, through circuits” (*Lezioni* 10). Like a digital processor, the *operazione* of the chessboard toggles between a pair of discrete values: one and zero, something and nothing (where *nulla* echoes *nullo*: null, void, invalid). The bit (or *binary digit*) is the elementary unit of information, the unit that gives the digital its name: every number and every instruction manipulated by computers is ultimately encoded as an array of binary digits. Although bits are proverbially described as ones and zeros, Calvino’s use of *nulla* here registers a pivotal distinction between the binary and the numeric: a sequence of bits can *encode* a number, but they do not *represent* it. In his notes for the Norton lectures, Calvino uses the bit as the exemplary instance of lightness precisely because it lacks any sensible texture or conceptual heft: in the post-industrial epoch, “[t]here are still machines of iron, but they obey bits without weight” (10). If software is “in command,” that is because the bit, as an essentially *logical* category that only happens to be materialized by silicone chips, appears to transcend the machines it governs. An array of bits that encode a letter (as an 8-bit Unicode character, for example) may well be realized as an electrical charge on the device that stores it, but, as Aden Evens observes, “no longer does that materiality bear any inherent or sensible relation to the letter it encodes” [-@evens15 p. 11]. Data composed of bits is severed from sensible matter just as each individual bit is severed from every other bit (and from its own opposite value): a binary between presence and absence that is rigorously enforceable (if not always incorruptible). The bit is the “apotheosis” of abstraction, as Evens aptly puts it [-@evens15 9] – a unit of pure difference, a *grammē*, seemingly immaterial, immutable, and yet, like a kingly body, capable of assuming a material form.

<!---If new media also entail a new form of sovereignty, as many theorists have argued, that sovereignty has its basis in the abstraction of the bit.[^new-media-sovereignty] Every operation performed by a digital computer is stored as an array of bits. Those bits encode instructions compiled from source code written by a human programmer. And although the programmer has the power to tell the computer exactly what to do, her instructions must conform to the rigorous syntax of the programming language in which the code is written. Like the algebraic notation used in chess – which records a sequence of moves so precisely that they can exactly replayed – the code written by programmers represents a series of commands that the machine must execute in the exact form in which they are given. A single thread on a [CPU]{.smallcaps} core can perform only one operation at a time – and the order of those operations is guaranteed (at least in theory) to match the order of lines in the human-readable source. Operations form a queue from which they are dispatched in lockstep one after another. To the human programmer, source code appears as a series of lines (often but not always terminated by semicolons) that the compiler transforms into an executable binary: a program composed of bits that the processor can actually execute and run. In this way, the linearity of digital logic guarantees its iterability. Lineated code is compiled into an isomorphic series of executable instructions, and the processor, in turn, executes those instructions at runtime in a precise and immutable order. The identity between human instruction and machine execution, however, is not an intrinsic property of computation. A whole series of protocols – a vertical chain of command from the syntax of source code to the compiled binary – promises the perfect iterability of the original instruction. It is this iterability that defines the digital as such: an algorithm executed with a given set of parameters will always produce the same irrefragable result. In this way, the abstraction of the digital – its dream of transcending the endless variation of the physical world – gives rise to (and follows from) this fantasy of the human programmer (as well as the human user) as a sovereign with the power to execute unwavering commands.-->

But *Invisible Cities*, for its part, does not end with the deadlock of checkmate. Nor does the binary logic exemplified by chess succeed in governing the divergent subplots and lyric vignettes that fill the long gaps between the Khan’s decrees. Challenging established readings of the book as a defense of the rational and the geometric, many recent critics observe that Kublai, however formidable, contributes only one half of a dialogue in which Polo frequently holds the cards. Jennifer Scappetone, for example, argues that “[w]hile Kublai seeks refuge in the chessboard as a model of the invisible order that governs the destiny of cities, Polo’s telling stresses the ‘infinite deformities and discords’ that ultimately elude the imposition of a ‘coherent, harmonious system’ from without” [-@scappetone14 298]. Rather, Kublai and Polo together stage a dialectic between order and disorder, between the colorless geometry of the grid and the intricate texture of urban life that no abstract structure can map without remainder. Polo’s penchant for digression and deferral (often disguised as flattery and deference) not only frustrates the emperor’s desire to exhaustively chart and thereby govern his empire but also unravels the rhetorical and narrative forms that underwrite his power.

No sooner does the emperor posit the reducibility of his empire to a binary square than the Venetian explorer launches into an ekphrasis of the chessboard that undermines its function as a communicative medium.

> La tua scacchiera, sire, è un intarsio di due legni: ebano e acero. Il tassello sul quale si fissa il tuo sguardo illuminato fu tagliato in uno strato del tronco che crebbe in un anno di siccità: vedi come si dispongono le fibre? Qui si scorge un nodo appena accennato: una gemma tentò di spuntare in un giorno di primavera precoce, ma la brina della notte l’obbligò a desistere. (63)

> Your chessboard, sire, is inlaid with two woods: ebony and maple. The square on which your enlightened gaze is fixed was cut from the ring of a trunk that grew in a year of drought: you see how its fibers are arranged? Here a barely hinted knot can be made out: a bud tried to burgeon on a premature spring day, but the night’s frost forced it to desist. (131)

No longer a grid of information or a platform for gameplay, the chessboard appears for the first time as a solid block of wood. A hand-carved block, to be precise, whose rustic texture is untouched by mechanical reproduction: the wood has been cut by a lumberjack (“chosen for chopping down” rather than deforested) and “scored by the wood carver with his gouge.” Nothing about the board is uniform. It is made of two woods (“ebony and maple”) whose fibres, in marked distinction to the black and white squares, are inseparably interwoven. The surface bears traces of half-formed life: a knot left by a frozen bud, a pore gnawed through by a caterpillar. Even the grid of the chessboard is uneven, and protruding squares have been pared down by hand. If these details converge in a nostalgic (albeit ironized) scene of pastoral labor that suspends the clockwork of the game in a moment of idyllic reverie (a reverie, moreover, that seems largely indifferent to the imperial subjects on whose handiwork it depends), the passage also interrupts the emperor’s *operazione* in order to give the chessboard what the game (which quantizes time *volta a volta*, turn by turn) has so far precluded: a moment of sustained attention.

Directed toward a crafted artifact, this attention (and the heightened rhetoric it occasions) elevates the passage from a mere description of a woodblock into an ekphrastic description of an aesthetic object. Polo’s labored speech seems to absorb the solidity of the thing he evokes, charging language with the vividness of an image even as he digresses from (and thereby suspends) the Khan’s demand for narrative progression. The slightest hint of a plot is cut short and ossified into the woodgrain: a spring bud is frozen into a knot, a caterpillar into a hollow pore. Polo trades the lockstep of chess (and the imperial conquests it subtends) for what Murray Krieger calls the “still moment” of ekphrasis, the moment when image and text are “sutured” to each other and the properly temporal medium of language assumes the frozen guise of the artwork it evokes. Even as ekphrasis strives to narrativize the saccades of an eye roaming across the surface of an image, the ekphrastic description arrests the narrative in which it is embedded, imitating the solidity of painting or sculpture in a way that also intimates the stillness of death. As with Paul de Man’s analysis of prosopopoeia, the act of addressing an inanimate object not only animates the object but also strikes the living speaker dumb.[^prosopopoeia]
<!---TODO: Find Krieger citation.--->

[^prosopopoeia]: In *The Rhetoric of Romanticism*, de Man describes prosopopoeia as a form of “disfiguration” or “defacement” (114), where addressing an inanimate object as if it were alive simultaneously deprives the speaker of voice. At the same time that prosopopoeia makes the dead speak, “the living are struck dumb, frozen in their own death” (78).

But if classical ekphrasis presents the artwork as a singular object of attention, Polo’s ekphrasis of the chessboard dispels the aura of singularity by focusing on incongruous details that never quite form a coherent whole. The uneven squares, the interwoven fibres of ebony and maple, the knots left by critters and outgrowths: Polo is at pains to disclose the variety that mars the chessboard’s surface, revealing that it is not an isolated artifact but the confluence of many contingent forces. In this way, ekphrasis reverses the reduction of the chessboard to a mere substrate for binary information or stepwise gameplay: the noise that the game is compelled to elide (or more precisely to *quantize*, counting every square as all black or all white) returns in the form of a fine-grained description that regards even the minutest detail as worthy of attention. Put another way, the ekphrasis reveals a discrepancy between the insensible structure of information and the sensible texture of its material substrate: insofar as encoding information onto a binary grid presupposes the reduction of these minute variations into discrete quantities, the act of describing the chessboard reverses this process and unveils the multiplicity on which it depends.

The noise revealed by ekphrasis gestures towards a sort of mathematical sublime, a failure to make description coincide with a world that is either too vast or too minute to capture in its entirety. If Kublai sees the enormity of his empire reflected in the chessboard (with its nearly endless array of possible games), Polo sees the lives of insects traced in the woodgrain, just as he discerns, in the crumbling walls of imperial cities, “the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites’ gnawing” (6). This shift from the massive to the minute is one way of resisting the desire, embodied by Kublai, to subsume the particular under the general, to reduce the multiplicity of sensible experience to a binary code of white/black cells. Much as Perec often punctuates his lists with an et cetera that signifies the sublime excess of things too numerous to count, Calvino turns to ekphrasis as a way of allowing himself to be seized by “another vertigo, that of the detail of the detail of the detail”: the attempt (never more than tentative) to describe things in their multiplicity, to “divide” and “subdivide” the field of the visible and the sayable, refocuses his attention from “the infinitely vast” to “the infinitesimal, the infinitely small” (67-8).

Like enumeration, ekphrasis is a genre that struggles to delimit and contain its object. In *The Infinity of Lists*, Umberto Eco contrasts the potentially endless form of the list with Homer’s ekphrasis of Achilles’s shield, whose “perfectly circular nature suggests that there is nothing else beyond its bounds”: the shield is “a finite form,” “a closed world” with “no outside” (12). And yet the ekphrasis of the shield also digresses into an encyclopedic list that strives to encompass the totality of Greek life, ultimately erasing the distinction between the world circumscribed by the bronze rim of the *apsis* and the world in which it was forged.  To the extent that ekphrasis engages the artwork as a portal to a figured world, it risks allowing that world to grow beyond (and therefore disfigure) the frame of the artwork itself.<!---Sustained attention to a proximate object often reveals a motley of minutiae that warrant their own descriptions. Ekphrasis diverges from the linear momentum of plot in order to evoke a singular object, but that object in turn occasions further digressions that call its  own singularity into question.--> In a similar fashion, the ekphrasis of the chessboard in *Invisible Cities* moves swiftly from description to enumeration, embarking on an epic catalogue of images that seem to crawl out of the woodwork:

> La quantità di cose che si potevano leggere in un pezzetto di legno liscio e vuoto sommergeva Kublai; già Polo era venuto a parlare dei boschi d’ebano, delle zattere di tronchi che discendono i fiumi, degli approdi, delle donne alle finestre... (63)

> The quantity of things that could be read in a little piece of smooth and empty wood overwhelmed Kublai; Polo was already talking about ebony forests, about rafts laden with logs that come down the rivers, of docks, of women at the windows... (132)

On the one hand, this passage panders to Kublai’s desire to survey the chessboard as a microcosm of his empire, a grid that could reduce the multiplicity of cities described by Polo to a single “quantity.” Taking the form of the list (a form, as Perec reminds us, that counts as well as recounts the elements it enumerates), Polo’s description feeds the emperor’s ambition to embody the “sum of all wonders” and to distill narrative digression into informative summary (5). Like many of Perec’s lists, however, this one ends with an ellipse: a device that promises continuity and completion while exposing the list to an innumerable surfeit of things that remain unsaid. Just as the ekphrasis of the chessboard reveals a multiplicity of details within its surface, the list suggests that each of those details in turn unfolds into a multiplicity of wooden artifacts adrift in imaginary cities: out of the woodgrain grow forests, rafts, logs, windowsills. A vertigo of details within details: it is not simply things, but  the “quantity of things” that overwhelms Kublai (*sommergeva*, literally submerges or inundates him), a sort of mathematical sublime that defies the capacity of the imagination to intuit an image of the infinite. The ellipse gives voice to the unquantifiable, the countless details that make the chessboard not one object, but many.

The multiplicity that ekphrasis reveals within the grain of the chessboard – an essentially spatial form – finds a temporal counterpart in digression, a device that divides the singular chronology of plot into a multitude of forking paths. Ekphrasis offers a respite from the narrative continuity that Kublai attempts in vain to impose on Polo’s maddeningly digressive account. It suspends both the causal logic of plot and the quantized time of chess, a time governed by sequential moves and the swift execution of unquestionable commands. It is this regimented sense of time that Calvino contrasts with the pleasures of digression in his memo on “Quickness,” citing Carlo Levi’s introduction to an Italian translation of *Tristram Shandy*:

> La morte sta nascosta negli orologi, come diceva il Belli; e l’infelicità della vita individuale, di questo frammento, di questa cosa scissa e disgregata, e priva di totalità: la morte, che è il tempo, il tempo della individuazione, della separazione, l’astratto tempo che rotola verso la sua fine. (46)

> Death is hidden in clocks, as Belli said, along with the unhappiness of individual life, of this fragment, of this thing that is divided and disintegrated, deprived of wholeness: death, which is time, the time of individuation, of separation, the abstract time that rolls towards it end.

If abstract time disintegrates the continuum of lived experience by making it calculable and accountable, digression redoubles this fragmentation in order to make time “so complex, tangled, tortuous, and so rapid as to obscure its own tracks.” Clock time divides the temporally continuous into the spatially discrete, a process of grammatization, as Stiegler observes in his reading of Heidegger in *Technics and Time*, that reveals “[t]he ‘clockness’ of the *grammē*, or rather the *grammē* or programmness of the clock” [-@stiegler94 p. 224]. If Heidegger’s antidote to the administered time of modernity is to champion the yet undiscretized presence of the *now* (a move that Stiegler critiques as fundamentally logocentric), Levi proposes an alternative model in which narrative digression, rather than nostalgically seeking to restore “wholeness,” reveals a difference, a fracture, within clock time itself.

On the one hand, then, Polo’s ekphrasis gives the chessboard (as well as the prose through which it becomes visible) a sort of fragile solidity, allowing language to congeal – and this is the ekphrastic illusion – into an almost sculptural form that evokes the texture and heft of a silent work of art. <!---But you’ve already said it’s multiple, divergent. And the idea of the *sublime* is introduced earlier. I’d consider moving this up and having a whole section on the ineffable.-->At the same time, the ekphrasis digresses from and thereby thwarts Kublai’s desire to propel the narrative forward, suspending the clockwork with which the book divides time into discrete episodes and sequential (if ultimately inconsequential) events. Ekphrasis is always digressive to the extent that it foregoes the causal entanglements of plot for the dilated and often asynchronous time of description (as in Homer’s ekphrasis of Achilles’ shield, where a story of oxen plowing a golden field becomes indissociable from the forging of the golden shield itself as well as the writing of the furrowed lines of the poem: three moments, all superimposed). <!---TODO: Rephrase this parenthetical remark to make the three images more parallel.-->But Polo’s ekphrasis of the chessboard is also digressive in the more narrow sense defined by Levi, interrupting the discretized and purely logical time of the game <!---(a time already at odds with the digressive travelogues that preface it)-->with a description that is much too hesitant, too carefully qualified to achieve that sense of ambient stasis that distinguishes the ekphrastic mode. Of course, one could agree with W. J. T. Mitchell that hesitancy and self-doubt are themselves hallmarks of the genre, registering an ethical ambivalence toward the other as well as toward the artwork whose alterity ekphrasis seeks to neutralize [^mitchell]. In Polo’s case, however, the tentative character of his speech also extends a long line of similarly halting (and unabashedly ekphrastic) descriptions of cities, many of which begin with a modesty *topos* that is as impish as it is disarming. <!--TODO: Add footnote with a list of examples of this modesty *topos*--><!---Ekphrasis is one way of navigating the tension between mathematical and rhetorical modes of description that Calvino describes in the memo on “Exactness”: (…).-->It is through omissions, negations, and slippages that the ekphrastic object imprints itself on language as a sort of negative impression: a “black hole,” to borrow Mitchell’s phrase for the sublimely ineffable artwork that remains forever indescribable even as it warps language around the gravity of its absence [-@mitchell94 p. 158].

In a 1974 letter to Giovanni Falaschi, who reviewed *Invisible Cities* and *The Castle of Crossed Destinies* in *Belfagor*, Calvino objects to the suggestion that the empty square of the chessboard signifies the impossibility of empirical knowledge, observing that, in the same passage, “one learns that this apparent void is full of the details of real life, and that one can read these indefinitely” (381). If the journey reveals nothing but “approximations and errors,” that is because there is “no other form of knowledge except that which is gained through successive approximations and corrections of mistakes” (382). It is precisely because objects can never be exhaustively described that they continue to occasion description. The letter echoes his earlier remark in a 1967 essay on comedy:

> Una cosa si può dirla almeno in due modi: un modo per cui chi la dice vuol dire quella cosa e solo quella; e un modo per cui si vuol dire sí quella cosa, ma nello stesso tempo ricordare che il mondo è molto piú complicato e vasto e contraddittorio. (“Comico” 157)

> A thing can be said in at least two ways: one way in which, in saying it, you want to say that thing and that thing alone; and one way in which you want to say that thing, certainly, but at the same time remember that the world is much more complicated and vast and contradictory.

It is this desire to register traces of a contradictory world that tempers Calvino’s penchant for formal harmony and geometric rigor. In the Harvard lectures, almost twenty years later, he contrasts the exactitude of mathematics with the more elusive forms of exactitude pursued by literary description. Exactitude concerns, “[o]n the one hand, the reduction of contingent events to abstract schemes like the ones used to perform operations and demonstrate theorems; on the other, the effort of words to account as precisely as possible for the sensible aspect of things” (72). Despite the crisp parallelism of this analogy, description differs radically from calculation in its desire to confront the contingency of the sensible world – a collision between words and things that mars the texture of descriptive prose and makes an otherwise fluent style seem tentative and hesitant. In Calvino’s words: “[I]n accounting for the density and continuity of the world around us, language reveals itself as lacunose, fragmentary: it always says something *less* than the totality of what can be experienced [*totalità dell’esperibile*]” (72). Description is paradoxically most exact when it admits the impossibility of coinciding with its object: to say a thing “more than one way” is to describe it again and again, each attempt a little nearer the mark – a history of errors, of estimates and corrections, that never converge into the finality of an equation.

In this sense, Calvino shares with Perec a desire to mediate between number, word, and image, to offset the rigor of formal constraints with what Manet van Montfrans, in the subtitle of his influential study on Perec, calls “la Contrainte du réel.”<!---the way in which the world resists (and therefore drives) our desire to give phenomena an intelligible form.--> The dialogue between Kublai and Polo stages a literary analogue of the tension that Perec discerns in enumeration: just as a list oscillates between the promise to exhaust its topic and the et cetera that leaves it incomplete, the dialectic at the heart of *Invisible Cities* mediates between a desire to govern the world through calculation and the rhetorical forms – description, digression – through which an incalculable, ungovernable world pushes back. As Perec does with the infra-ordinary, constructing tentative lists of the details of quotidian life, Calvino sets out to approximate experience through “the impalpable dust of words” (74), crafting images of a world that is too granular, too noisy, to conform to his otherwise attenuated style – much less to the protocols and axioms that would otherwise reduce life to the order of weightless bits.
<!--[*l’impalpabile pulviscolo delle parole*]-->

Reading Perec and Calvino this way gestures towards a broader entanglement of potential literature with new media, anticipating the ways in which poets two decades later, at the turn of the millennium, will adapt the tradition of writing *sous contrainte* to respond to a digital milieu – only just nascent at the founding of the Oulipo – that has since exploded into the fully networked, fully quantified realm we inhabit today. What Perec and Calvino offer their millennial successors is the sense, perhaps utopian, that the sovereignty of data, for all its glossy surface, conceals points of fracture that potential literature is especially poised to reveal. By making the digital itself (or the formal logic on which it depends) an object of literary description, potential literature gives a sensible texture to what is properly insensible: structures of information – lists and grids – that never quite manage to filter out the noise, the granularity, on which literature thrives.

[^calvino-translations]: Translations from the Norton lectures – and, unless otherwise noted, from Calvino’s critical essays – are my own. Gregory Brock’s 2016 version of *Six Memos*, although an improvement on the anonymous 1988 translation from Harvard University Press, still takes considerable liberties, and my argument leans heavily on the precise diction of the Italian. For the same reason, all of the block quotations from Calvino in this chapter cite both languages in parallel. In cases where an edition has substantially shaped his reception among anglophone readers, such as William Weaver’s translation of *Invisible Cities*, I point out salient differences, which are often illuminating in and of themselves.

[^new-media-sovereignty]: Especially in Agamben’s reformulation of the term, sovereignty has become a pivotal concept for media scholars attempting to think through the persistence of executive power after the rise of decentralized networks. In *Programmed Visions*, for example, Wendy Chun draws a compelling analogy between the sovereign prerogative to kill and let live and the way software divides power between compilable source and executable code, a division that encodes the historical (and typically gendered) division of labor between computers and operators at a time when both roles were still performed by humans.<!---Also see @hu15, *A Prehistory of the Cloud* (especially 11-27 on “the sovereignty of data”).-->

[^zany]: In a 1971 letter to Paolo Valesia, Calvino makes a similarly modest proposal for “a hypothetical language, an attempt at linguistic construction outside the rules of rhetoric and logic, a language without a speaking subject, language of things, Gurdulù-language” – or, put another way, “this language of the Other/the Devil/the Zanni/the Fool” (409). A popular figure in the *commedia del arte*, the Zanni plays a dispossessed worker from the Lombard countryside who serves the wealthy nobles and merchants of Venice, contorting his body into acrobatic movements that substitute for his absent speech. Sianne Ngai traces the modern legacy of this figure by arguing that the zany constitutes an aesthetic category in its own right, encompassing “the intensely embodied affects and desires of an agent compelled to move, hustle, and perform in the presence of others” [-@ngai10 950].

[^tangle]: In “Exactitude,” Calvino uses these terms to describe *Invisible Cities*:

	 > Un simbolo più complesso, che mi ha dato le maggiori possibilità di esprimere la tensione tra razionalità geometrica e groviglio delle esistenze umane e quello della città. (70)

	> A more complex symbol, which gave me the greatest opportunity to express the tension between geometric rationality and the tangle of human existences, is that of the city.

    The passage echoes his earlier comparison between “the bustling spectacle of the world \[*il morimentato spettacolo del mondo*], by turns dramatic and grotesque, and the picaresque, adventurous inner rhythm that spurred me to write” (5-6).

[^mitchell]: In “Ekphrasis and the Other,” @mitchell94 defines three ekphrastic dispositions (hope, fear, and indifference) that all seek to contain the profound sense of alterity to which ekphrasis gives voice. Many of his examples, drawn from romantic and modernist poetry, oppose the voyeuristic gaze of the male poet (conveyed to an audience also presumed to be male) to a female body that at once yields to his desire and threatens, like Medusa, to return his gaze and freeze the voyeur into an image of the static artwork he describes. <!--TODO: Consider adding comment on medusa from *Six Memos*.-->

[^chessboard-novel]:	Compare the structure of George Perec’s *La vie mode d’emploi*, a novel whose ninety-nine chapters correspond (minus one exception) to the grid of a ten-by-ten chessboard. This chessboard, in turn, maps the façade of a Parisian apartment, and the chapters jump from room to room, following the pattern of a knight that touches every square on the board only once. Calvino praises this work in his memo on “Multiplicity,” comparing it to Balzac’s *Comédie humaine* and calling it “the last real event in the history of the novel” (117). For a comparative reading of *La vie mode d’emploi* and *Le città invisibili* (with a detour through Walter Benjamin’s *Passagenwerk*), see @chiesa06.

[^xanadu]:	In a letter dated 2 September 1960, concerning a theatrical production with Mario Monicelli and Suso Cecchi D’Amico, Calvino describes his attempt “to follow Coleridge’s method: by smoking opium and reading Marco Polo he managed to compose in a dream-like trance ‘In Xanadu did Kublai Khan’” (202). This project eventually became *Invisible Cities*: a decade later, in a letter to Gianni Celati dated 12 December 1970, Calvino notes that he is at work on “a remake of Marco Polo’s *Il Milione* full of brief descriptions of imaginary cities” (ctd. in @modena11 191). He recalls this connection in a 1983 lecture at Columbia University, comparing *Invisible Cities* to the work of other writers inspired by Polo’s travelogue: “Coleridge in his famous poem, Kafka in *The Emperor’s Message*, Dino Buzzati in his novel *The Desert of Tartars*.” What brings these influences together is not just their use of *Il Milione* as a source text but their desire to discover there an imaginary “elsewhere,” a romantic horizon that fades as the world becomes, in Calvino’s words, “more and more uniform (and for the worse)” (179).

    For a fine-grained (and mostly sympathetic) critique of Weaver’s translation, see @mclaughlin10 211–17.
