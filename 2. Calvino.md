# The Sovereign Grid: Code and Image in Italo Calvino

 In *Six Memos for the Next Millenium*, a series composed for the 1985 Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard, Calvino describes *Invisible Cities* as “something between a fable and a petit poème on prose,” an effort to achieve “a peculiar density … that finds its proper dimension in the single page” [-@calvino-memos p. 49]. *Petits Poèmes en prose* is the subtitle of Baudelaire’s *Le spleen de Paris*, and Calvino’s prose shares many of the qualities of the post-romantic or symbolist lyric – from its synesthetic descriptions and sense of suspended time (underscored grammatically by the continual present) to the way that Marco Polo interrupts his solitary monologue to address his silent audience (“wise Kublai” is an apostrophe as much to the reader as to the emperor). In many ways the book more closely resembles a collection of lyric poems than it does a novel: the plot is so meticulously uneventful that the chapters can be read in any order. It is a world where nothing happens (or that *makes* nothing happen, as Auden says of poetry) and where anything that does happen is strategically inconsequential.

At the same time, however, Calvino draws an implicit analogy between the highly condensed and immaterial world of the lyric and the dematerialization of physical media in what he calls “our post-industrial age of technology”: in these “congested times,” when data flows along electric circuits with unimaginable speed and yet we grow increasingly sluggish amid an abundance of information, the compactness of potential literature seems especially felicitous. If Calvino dreams of “immense cosmologies, sagas, and epics reduced to the dimension of an epigram,” he also dreams of all human knowledge placed in the storage capacity of a microchip – in an age when “orders of weightless bits” supersede a modernist iconology of “rolling mills and molten steel” [-@calvino-memos 8].

Later in the lectures, exemplifying the “exactitude” promised by this computational turn, Calvino cites a passage from *Invisible Cities* in which Kublai Khan attempts to map his empire onto the surface of a chessboard.[^chessboard-novel] A Cartesian grid whose sixty-four squares align with the book’s sixty-four chapters, the chessboard is a fitting analogy for the “geometric rationalism” embodied by the emperor and his desire to reduce the “tangle” [*groviglio*] of urban life to a governable structure of lines and points [^tangle]. It is the chessboard that prompts Kublai to envision his empire as “a desert of labile and interchangeable data, like grains of sand, from which there appeared, for each city and province, the figures evoked by the Venetian’s logographs” (22). Chess is a medium that allows the two characters to establish “a different communication”: when Polo arrives at the court “totally ignorant of the Levantine languages,” he expresses himself “with objects he took from his knapsacks – ostrich plumes, peashooters, quartzes – which he arranged in front of him like chessmen” (21). At first blush, this strained effort to communicate with objects (“a helmet, a seashell, a coconut, a fan” [121]) evokes a sort of nostalgia for the lost immediacy of things – an allusion, perhaps, to the professors at Jonathan Swift’s Academy of Lagado, who carry enormous sacks containing every possible object they might need to name. In a 1971 letter to Paolo Valesia, Calvino calls for just such a language, which he associates with the Renaissance figure of the Zanni: “a hypothetical language, an attempt at linguistic construction outside the rules of rhetoric and logic, a language without a speaking subject, language of things, Gurdulù-language ...” (409). The Zanni is a popular character in the *commedia del arte*: a dispossessed worker from the Lombard countryside who serves the wealthy nobles and merchants of Venice, contorting his body into acrobatic movements that replace his absent speech. Sianne Ngai traces the modern legacy of this figure by arguing that the zany constitutes an aesthetic category in its own right, encompassing “the intensely embodied affects and desires of an agent compelled to move, hustle, and perform in the presence of others” [-@ngai10 950]. Polo is a little zany himself: before he learns to speak with objects, he can “express himself only with gestures, leaps, cries of wonder and of horror, animal barkings or hootings” (21). The objects arranged on the chessboard signify nothing on their own (nor do they fulfill Calvino’s hypothesis of a primordial language where things signify themselves). It is Polo’s animate body – his “improvised pantomimes” – that the khan must “interpret” and “decipher”: a city depicted by “the leap of a fish escaping the cormorant’s beak” or “a naked man [*l’uomo nudo*] running through fire unscorched” (21). A comically excessive display of affect that animates and enlivens the body, these gestures also encipher the body into a mere instrument of semiosis: speech is stripped away, but rather than returning to a naïve or prelinguistic sense of completeness, Polo performs – at the command of his sovereign – a form of nude life from which the dignity and polity imparted by speech has been subtracted. The desire to overcome his muteness through zany gestures only further reveals the degree to which his performance, staged on the surface of a life-sized chessboard, is subject to the emperor’s self-legitimating power.

[^tangle]: In “Exactitude,” Calvino uses these terms to describe *Invisible Cities*:

	 > Un simbolo più complesso, che mi ha dato le maggiori possibilità di esprimere la tensione tra razionalità geometrica e groviglio delle esistenze umane e quello della città. [-@calvino-lezioni]
	 <!---TODO: Find page number.-->
    <!---[-@calvino-saggi vol. 1 p. 689]-->

    > A more complex symbol, one that gave me the greatest opportunity to express the tension between geometric rationality and the tangle of human lives, is that of the city. [-@calvino-memos]
    <!---TODO: Find page number.-->

    The passage echoes his earlier comparison between “the bustling spectacle of the world \[*il morimentato spettacolo del mondo*], by turns dramatic and grotesque, and the picaresque, adventurous inner rhythm that spurred me to write” [-@calvino-memos 4].

What Calvino calls “a language without a speaking subject,” then, undergoes a grotesque inversion in *Invisible Cities*. Rather than allow gestures to signify the continuity of a world that has not yet been discretized by alphabetic writing (as Swift does), the text codifies the gesturing body itself into the differential logic of the grid. Calvino stages a crisis analogous to the one that Bernard Stiegler (after Jacques Derrida) ascribes to the invention of alphabetic writing, fracturing an illusory ”state of continuity” into “a play of analyzable, diacritical, combinatorial elements” [-@stiegler02 p. 160]. *Invisible Cities* traces this combinatory logic from writing to the city itself: the citizens of Zenobia, for instance, imagine a replica of their metropolis that is “perhaps quite different, a-flutter with banners and ribbons, but always derived by combining elements of that first model” (35). The chessboard enacts this combinatory in miniature: an eight-by-eight grid that analyzes even gestures and interjections into a grammar composed of discrete signs. But unlike natural language, where signifiers acquire meaning through shared convention, the language of the chessboard takes on a sovereign force the moment each object is *assigned* an arbitrary referent:

> A ogni pezzo si poteva volta a volta attribuire un significato appropriato: un cavallo poteva rappresentare tanto un vero cavallo quanto un corteo di carrozze, un esercito in marcia, un monumento equestre; e una regina poteva essere una dama affacciata al balcone, una fontana, una chiesa dalla cupola cuspidata, una pianta di mele cotogne. (57)

> To each piece, in turn, they could give an appropriate meaning: a knight could stand for a real horseman, or for a procession of coaches, an army on the march, an equestrian monument: a queen could be a lady looking down from her balcony, a fountain, a church with a pointed dome, a quince tree. (121)

If William Weaver’s translation effaces the semiotic valence of some of these words (*rappresentare*, *significato*) in favor of familiar monosyllables, his crib of *cupola* as *dome* adds another layer of meaning by echoing Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan,” one of Calvino’s models for the book.[^xanadu] Like his romantic namesake (who did “a stately pleasure dome decree” – above “a mighty fountain” and “many an incense-bearing tree” [2-19]), the emperor of *Invisible Cities* decrees his *duomo*, fountain, and quince tree through a speech act that both engenders and replaces the things it names. The sovereign act of naming aligns with the decisive operations permitted by the grid: the connection between signifier and signified is not merely arbitrary but forcibly arbitrated into being. At the same time, the use of passive voice in the Italian (“*si poteva volta a volta attribuire*”: to each piece *could be attributed*) abstracts the source of this power away from the emperor to the game itself (which is played “*volta a volta*,” turn by turn). If the passage draws an analogy between sovereign power and the power of a chess player over the pieces he commands, it also reveals the degree to which the emperor is subject to protocols outside his control. Chess permits little ambiguity: a piece cannot occupy more than one cell at once (by straddling the border between two cells, for example) nor can the game be left suspended between two turns (as any novice discovers who unwittingly lets go of a piece before fully committing to its new position, an action that irrevocably ends the turn.) Each piece occupies both an absolute point in the sequence of turns and an absolute position on the grid. These two systems converge in the algebraic notation used to record games (and codified quite strictly by the Fédération Internationale des Échecs), where a step-by-step ledger coordinates the exact coordinates of each piece at any given point in time (“[c]{.smallcaps}5,” for example, signifies a classic opener: a pawn advancing two spaces to the third column of the fifth row). When Kublai compels Polo to contort his body across the surface of a life-sized chessboard, then, he also makes the board a figure for the structures that precede and condition his own authority. If the emperor succeeds in deciphering Polo’s pantomime of cities, it is only because he is himself “an emblem among emblems” (23).

This tension between sovereign power and rigorous protocol comes to a fore at the end of book, when the chessboard allegory reaches its logical conclusion.

> Allo scacco matto, sotto il piede del re sbalzato via dalla mano del vincitore, resta un quadrato nero o bianco. A forza di scorporare le sue conquiste per ridurle all’essenza, Kublai era arrivato all’operazione estrema: la conquista definitiva, di cui i multiformi tesori dell’impero non erano che involucri illusori, si riduceva a un tassello di legno piallato: il nulla... (58)

> At checkmate, beneath the foot of the king, knocked aside by the winner’s hand, a black or a white square remains. By disembodying his conquests to reduce them to the essential, Kublai had arrived at the extreme operation: the definitive conquest, of which the empire’s multiform treasures were only illusory envelopes. It was reduced to a square of planed wood: nothingness... (131)

*Scacco matto*: a synecdoche for regicide. Kublai concludes his meditation on chess with the figurative death of a king. Checkmate “disembod[ies]” him, or rather he arrives at the *essenza* of chess only by force (*a forza*) of his own excorporation. The verb *scorporare* (from ecclesiastical Latin: *(e)xcorporare*, to dissolve a body or uniform substance) carries a legal and economic force in Italian: to expropriate part of a whole in order to redistribute it elsewhere, such as removing land from an inheritance [@scorporare]. In this context, as an antonym of *incorporate*, it recalls the theological doctrine of the king’s two bodies: the emperor embodies a divinely ordained kingship to the extent that his power is excorporated from (and therefore able to outlive) his mortal body. With every checkmate a king dies, and yet the king survives to play another game.

This sovereign afterlife depends in turn upon the differential logic of the chessboard, the “black or white square” on which the king’s chess piece lies toppled and deposed. Kublai arrives at the *ezzenza* of sovereignty by way of an *operazione*, a word that combines military conquest, surgical precision, and algebraic calculation: in chess, the tactics of warfare coincide precisely with formal operations performed on a grid. The operation is “extreme” and “definitive” to the degree that it excludes the possibility of a middle term: either the white king dies or the black. Black or white: a binary that describes the outcome, not of a particular game (underscored by the indefinite article: *un quadrato* and not *questo quadrato*), but every possible game, which can be reduced to one of two possibles outcomes. A multiplicity of conquests inheres in “a square of plain wood”: not a *quadrato*, a shape capable of standing alone, defined by its angles and edges, but a *tassello*, a shape that exists only as part of a pattern, a shape that can *tessellate*, forming a mosaic by repeating itself without overlapping or leaving gaps (as in Escher’s images of chessboards formed from the tessellated silhouettes of birds). The shift from *quadrato* to *tassello* in the passage fortifies the analogy between sovereign force and binary logic: the square on which the “definitive conquest” takes place is itself defined purely by difference, one stitch in a recursive pattern where each element signifies only the absence of its neighbor.

A *tassello* is also a wedge or a plug, with the same technical connotation as in English: a device that draws electricity from a socket. If this plug is capable of powering Kublai’s empire, it is partly because it is a conduit for those “weightless bits,” as Calvino calls them, that “flow, as electrical impulses, through circuits” [-@calvino-memos 9]. Like a digital processor, the *operazione* of the chessboard toggles between a pair of discrete values: one and zero, something and nothing (where *nulla* echoes *nullo*: null, void, invalid). The bit (or *binary digit*) is the elementary unit of information, the unit that gives the digital its name: every number and every instruction manipulated by computers is ultimately encoded as an array of binary digits. Although bits are proverbially described as ones and zeros, Calvino’s use of *nulla* here registers a pivotal distinction between the binary and the numeric: a sequence of bits can *encode* a number, but they do not *represent* it. In his notes for the Norton lectures, Calvino uses the bit as the exemplary instance of lightness [*leggerezza*] precisely because it lacks any sensible texture or conceptual heft: in the post-industrial epoch, “[t]here are still machines of iron, but they obey bits without weight” [“ma obbediscono ai *bits* senza peso”] [-@calvino-lezioni].<!---Find page number---> If “software is in command” [il *software* che command] [-@calvino-lezioni],<!---Find page number---> that is because the bit, as an essentially *logical* category that only happens to be materialized by silicone chips, appears to transcend the machines it governs. An array of bits that encode a letter (as an 8-bit Unicode character, for example) may well be realized as an electrical charge on the device that stores it, but, as Aden Evens observes, “no longer does that materiality bear any inherent or sensible relation to the letter it encodes” [-@evens15 p. 11]. Data composed of bits is severed from sensible matter just as each individual bit is severed from every other bit (and from its own opposite value): a binary between presence and absence that is rigorously enforceable (if not always incorruptible). The bit is the “apotheosis” of abstraction, as Evens aptly puts it [-@evens15 9] – a unit of pure difference, a *grammē*, seemingly immaterial, immutable, and yet, like a kingly body, capable of assuming a material form.

If new media also entail a new form of sovereignty, as many theorists have argued, that sovereignty has its basis in the abstraction of the bit.[^new-media-sovereignty] Every operation performed by a digital computer is stored as an array of bits. Those bits encode instructions compiled from source code written by a human programmer. And although the programmer has the power to tell the computer exactly what to do, her instructions must conform to the rigorous syntax of the programming language in which the code is written. Like the algebraic notation used in chess – which records a sequence of moves so precisely that they can exactly replayed – the code written by programmers represents a series of commands that the machine must execute in the exact form in which they are given. A single thread on a [CPU]{.smallcaps} core can perform only one operation at a time – and the order of those operations is guaranteed (at least in theory) to match the order of lines in the human-readable source. Operations form a queue from which they are dispatched in lockstep one after another. To the human programmer, source code appears as a series of lines (often but not always terminated by semicolons) that the compiler transforms into an executable binary: a program composed of bits that the processor can actually execute and run. In this way, the linearity of digital logic guarantees its iterability. Lineated code is compiled into an isomorphic series of executable instructions, and the processor, in turn, executes those instructions at runtime in a precise and immutable order. The identity between human instruction and machine execution, however, is not an intrinsic property of computation. A whole series of protocols – a vertical chain of command from the syntax of source code to the compiled binary – promises the perfect iterability of the original instruction. It is this iterability that defines the digital as such: an algorithm executed with a given set of parameters will always produce the same irrefragable result. In this way, the abstraction of the digital – its dream of transcending the endless variation of the physical world – gives rise to (and follows from) this fantasy of the human programmer (as well as the human user) as a sovereign with the power to execute unwavering commands.

[^new-media-sovereignty]: Especially in Agamben’s reformulation of the term, sovereignty has become a pivotal concept for media scholars attempting to think through the persistence of executive power after the rise of decentralized networks. In *Programmed Visions*, for example, Wendy @chun11 draws a compelling analogy between the sovereign prerogative to kill and let live and the way software divides power between compilable source and executable code, a division that encodes the historical (and typically gendered) division of labor between computers and operators at a time when both roles were still performed by humans. Also see @hu15, *A Prehistory of the Cloud* (especially 11-27 on “the sovereignty of data”).

But *Invisible Cities*, for its part, does not end with the deadlock of checkmate. Nor does the binary logic exemplified by chess succeed in governing the divergent subplots and lyric vignettes that fill the long gaps between the Khan’s decrees. Challenging established readings of the book as a defense of the rational and the geometric, many recent critics observe that Kublai, however formidable, contributes only one half of a dialogue in which Polo frequently holds the cards. Jennifer Scappetone, for example, argues that “[w]hile Kublai seeks refuge in the chessboard as a model of the invisible order that governs the destiny of cities, Polo’s telling stresses the ‘infinite deformities and discords’ that ultimately elude the imposition of a ‘coherent, harmonious system’ from without” [-@scappetone14 298]. Rather, Kublai and Polo together stage a dialectic between order and disorder, between the colorless geometry of the grid and the intricate texture of urban life that no abstract structure can map without remainder. Polo’s penchant for digression and deferral (often disguised as flattery and deference) not only frustrates the emperor’s desire to exhaustively chart and thereby govern his empire but also unravels the rhetorical and narrative forms that underwrite his power.

The most significant of these digressions follows immediately after the passage quoted above. No sooner does the emperor posit the reducibility of his empire to a binary square than the Venetian explorer launches into an ekphrasis of the chessboard itself that systematically undermines its function as a communicative medium.

> La tua scacchiera, sire, è un intarsio di due legni: ebano e acero. Il tassello sul quale si fissa il tuo sguardo illuminato fu tagliato in uno strato del tronco che crebbe in un anno di siccità: vedi come si dispongono le fibre? Qui si scorge un nodo appena accennato: una gemma tentò di spuntare in un giorno di primavera precoce, ma la brina della notte l’obbligò a desistere. (63)

> Your chessboard, sire, is inlaid with two woods: ebony and maple. The square on which your enlightened gaze is fixed was cut from the ring of a trunk that grew in a year of drought: you see how its fibers are arranged? Here a barely hinted knot can be made out: a bud tried to burgeon on a premature spring day, but the night’s frost forced it to desist. (131)

No longer a grid of information or a platform for gameplay, the chessboard appears for the first time as a solid block of wood. A hand-carved block, to be precise, whose rustic texture is untouched by mechanical reproduction: the wood has been cut by a lumberjack (“chosen for chopping down” rather than deforested) and “scored by the wood carver with his gouge.” Nothing about the board is uniform. It is made of two woods (“ebony and maple”), interwoven in such a way that the two types of fibre – and even the rings of their separate tree trunks – remain distinct. The surface bears traces of half-formed life: a knot left by a frozen bud, a pore gnawed through by a caterpillar. Even the grid of the chessboard is uneven, and protruding squares have been pared down by hand. If these details converge in a nostalgic (albeit ironized) scene of pastoral labor that suspends the clockwork of the game in a moment of idyllic reverie (a reverie, moreover, that seems largely indifferent to the imperial subjects on whose handiwork it depends), the passage also interrupts the emperor’s *operazione* in order to give the chessboard what the clockwork of the game (which quantizes time *volta a volta*, turn by turn) have so far precluded: a moment of sustained attention.

Directed toward a crafted artifact, this attention (and the heightened rhetoric it occasions) elevates the passage from a mere description of a woodblock into an ekphrastic description of an aesthetic object. Polo’s labored speech seems to absorb the solidity of the thing he evokes, charging language with the vividness of an image even as he digresses from (and thereby suspends) the Khan’s demand for narrative progression. The slightest hint of a plot is cut short and ossified into the woodgrain: a spring bud is frozen into a knot, a caterpillar a hollow pore. Polo trades the lockstep of chess (and the imperial conquests it subtends) for what Murray Krieger calls the “still moment” of ekphrasis, the moment when image and text are “sutured” to each other and the properly temporal medium of language assumes the frozen guise of the artwork it evokes. Even as ekphrasis strives to narrativize the saccades of an eye roaming across the surface of an image, the ekphrastic description itself arrests the narrative in which it is embedded, imitating the solidity of painting or sculpture in a way that also intimates the stillness of death. As with Paul de Man’s analysis of prosopopoeia, the act of addressing an inanimate object not only animates the object but also strikes the living speaker dumb.[^prosopopoeia]

[^prosopopoeia]: In *The Rhetoric of Romanticism*, De Man describes prosopopoeia as a form of “disfiguration” or “defacement” (114), where addressing an inanimate object as if it were alive simultaneously deprives the speaker of voice. At the same time that prosopopoeia makes the dead speak, “the living are struck dumb, frozen in their own death” (78).

Diverging from the chronology of plot, Polo’s ekphrasis also offers a respite from the quantized time of the game, a time governed by sequential moves and the swift execution of unquestionable commands. In his memo on “Quickness,” Calvino contrasts the rigor of such clock time with the pleasures of digression, citing Carlo Levi’s introduction to an Italian translation of *Tristram Shandy*:

> La morte sta nascosta negli orologi, come diceva il Belli; e l’infelicità della vita individuale, di questo frammento, di questa cosa scissa e disgregata, e priva di totalità: la morte, che è il tempo, il tempo della individuazione, della separazione, l’astratto tempo che rotola verso la sua fine. [-@calvino-lezioni]

> Death is hidden in clocks, as Belli said, along with the unhappiness of individual life, of this fragment, of this thing that is divided, disintegrated, deprived of wholeness – death, which is time, the time of individuation, of separation, the abstract time that rolls toward its end. [-@calvino-memos]

If abstract time disintegrates the continuum of lived experience by making it calculable and accountable, digression redoubles this fragmentation in order to make time “so complex, tangled, tortuous, and so rapid as to obscure its own tracks.” Clock time divides the temporally continuous into the spatially discrete, a process of grammatization, as Stiegler observes in his reading of Heidegger in *Technics and Time*, that reveals “[t]he ‘clockness’ of the *grammē*, or rather the *grammē* or programmness of the clock” [-@stiegler94 p. 224]. If Heidegger’s antidote to the administered time of modernity is to champion the yet undiscretized presence of the *now* (a move that Stiegler critiques as fundamentally logocentric), Levi proposes an alternative model in which narrative digression, rather than nostalgically seeking to restore “wholeness,” reveals a self-difference at work *within* clock time itself.

On the one hand, then, Polo’s ekphrasis gives the chessboard (as well as the prose through which it becomes visible) a sort of fragile solidity, allowing language to congeal – and this is the ekphrastic illusion – into an almost sculptural form that evokes the texture and heft of a silent work of art. At the same time, the ekphrasis digresses from and thereby thwarts Kublai’s desire to propel the narrative forward, suspending the clockwork with which the book divides time into discrete episodes and sequential (if ultimately inconsequential) events. Ekphrasis is always digressive to the extent that it foregoes the causal entanglements of plot for the dilated and often asynchronous time of description (as in Homer’s ekphrasis of Achilles’ shield, where a story of oxen plowing a golden field becomes indissociable from the forging of the golden shield itself as well as the writing of the furrowed lines of the poem: three moments, all superimposed). But Polo’s ekphrasis of the chessboard is also digressive in the more narrow sense defined by Levi, interrupting the discretized and purely logical time of the game (a time already at odds with the digressive travelogues that preface it) with a description that is much too hesitant, too carefully qualified to achieve that sense of ambient stasis that distinguishes the ekphrastic mode. Of course, one could agree with W. J. T. Mitchell that hesitancy and self-doubt are themselves hallmarks of the genre, registering an ethical ambivalence toward the other as well as toward the artwork whose alterity ekphrasis seeks to neutralize [^mitchell]. In Polo’s case, however, the tentative character of his speech also extends a long line of similarly halting (and unabashedly ekphrastic) descriptions of cities, many of which begin with a modesty *topos* that is as impish as it is disarming. <!---Ekphrasis is one way of navigating the tension between mathematical and rhetorical modes of description that Calvino describes in the memo on “Exactness”: (…).-->It is through omissions, negations, and slippages that the ekphrastic object imprints itself on language as a sort of negative impression: a “black hole,” to borrow Mitchell’s phrase for the sublimely ineffable artwork that remains forever indescribable even as it warps language around the gravity of its absence [-@mitchell94 p. 158].

[^mitchell]: In “Ekphrasis and the Other,” @mitchell94 defines three ekphrastic dispositions (hope, fear, and indifference) that all seek to contain the profound sense of alterity to which ekphrasis gives voice. Many of his examples, drawn from romantic and modernist poetry, oppose the voyeuristic gaze of the male poet (conveyed to an audience also presumed to be male) to a female body that at once yields to his desire and threatens, like Medusa, to return his gaze and freeze the voyeur into an image of the static artwork he describes.

<!---The reduction of the empire to a black or white *tassello* depends, in turn, upon the reduction of the chessboard to a material substrate for the information it encodes. The sensible texture of the wood – its melange of ebony and maple, its knotted surface, and, presumably, any variation in the whiteness or blackness of its painted squares – must be quantized into a uniform grid that counts every square as either wholly black or wholly white and discounts everything else as noise. Together, these details disrupt the emperor’s attempt to reduce the chessboard to the binary logic of a white or black *tassello*, instead dissolving its surface into a welter of minutiae. Polo reveals a discrepancy between the insensible structure of information and the sensible texture of its material substrate. Insofar as encoding information onto a binary grid requires the reduction (or more precisely, the quantization) of these minute variations into discrete quantities – different shades of black or white count as pure white or black in relation to a certain threshold, for example – the act of describing the chessboard reverses this process and reveals the multiplicity on which it depends.-->

Stiegler argues that the digitization of the image (or “discretization,” to use his term: the encoding of images as discrete arrays of numeric values) stages an analogous crisis to the one inflicted on speech by the invention of alphabetic writing, revealing the fact that the continuous analog image is always already discrete. The discretized image destroys the “continguity of luminances” supposed to inhere in the analog image: the belief that light reflected off the photographic subject actually touches a strip of film, and that we are touched in turn by analogous lightwaves reflecting off the surface of the printed image. Every time Nadar’s famous photograph of Baudelaire is printed, for example, “this whole ‘umbilical cord’ constituted by the photons that come to imprint and *physically* touch, from out of the nineteenth century, the *photosensitive* silver halides” [-@stiegler02 152]. Analog media are indexical: they bear the imprint of physical waveforms (either lightwaves hitting unexposed film or soundwaves moving the diaphragm of a microphone) that analogically resemble the sounds and shapes that produced them. This is why photographs and phonographs are called analog in the first place: they store information in a form that is strictly analogous to its source. As Kittler observes:

> 	They are not only supposed to resemble the object, but rather guarantee this resemblance by being, as it were, a product of the object in question, that is, by being mechanically produced by it – just as the illuminated objects of reality imprint their image on the photo­graphic layer … a reproduction authenticated by the object itself. [-@kittler99 p. 11-12]

This continuity is destroyed by digital media: a bitmap image, for example, stores its data as an array of floating-point decimal values, each pixel represented by a triplet of such values (one each for red, green, and blue). A bitmap is discrete in at least two senses, strictly analogous to Kublai’s chessboard. First, the continuous plane of the image is divided into equally sized cells. Second, the average color of each cell is sampled (since the cell represents a minute region of light rather than a single point) and each color component of the sampled value is encoded as a floating-point number with a finite bit depth (an 8-bit number, for example, could represent one of 2^8^ or 256 discrete possible values). An image digitized in this way no longer *resembles* the scene it encodes: its relation to the physical lightwaves it records is purely one of statistical measurement. The digital image comprises a series of instructions for reconstructing an image – rather than an analogue of the original source. Because the digital image takes the form of a discrete code rather than a continuous texture, it can be exactly reproduced in any format capable of representing binary data: an image copied across physically diverse media (a solid-state drive, an optical disc, a wifi signal) remains structurally identical. Digital copying does away with the noise inherent in mechanical reproduction: although physical media can be corrupted, the data they store is itself an abstraction completely separate from its medium and can be perfectly reconstructed (as long as another copy exists). In this way, the digital sacrifices the continuity of analogy (where an image is coincident with its material substrate) for the iterability of code. The image becomes a form of writing, a form whose identity – to a degree unprecedented in alphabetic writing – can be rigorously enforced.

[^chessboard-novel]:	Compare the structure of George Perec’s *La vie mode d’emploi*, a novel whose ninety-nine chapters correspond (minus one exception) to the grid of a ten-by-ten chessboard. This chessboard, in turn, maps the façade of a Parisian apartment, and the chapters jump from room to room, following the pattern of a knight that touches every square on the board only once. Calvino praises this work in his memo on “Multiplicity,” comparing it to Balzac’s *Comédie humaine* and calling it “the last real event in the history of the novel.” For a comparative reading of *La vie mode d’emploi* and *Le città invisibili* (with a detour through Walter Benjamin’s *Passagenwerk*), see @chiesa06.

[^xanadu]:	In a letter dated 2 September 1960, concerning a theatrical production with Mario Monicelli and Suso Cecchi D’Amico, Calvino describes his attempt “to follow Coleridge’s method: by smoking opium and reading Marco Polo he managed to compose in a dream-like trance ‘In Xanadu did Kublai Khan’” (202). This project eventually became *Invisible Cities*: a decade later, in a letter to Gianni Celati dated 12 December 1970, Calvino notes that he is at work on “a remake of Marco Polo’s *Il Milione* full of brief descriptions of imaginary cities” (ctd. in @modena11 191). He recalls this connection in a 1983 lecture at Columbia University, comparing *Invisible Cities* to the work of other writers inspired by Polo’s travelogue: “Coleridge in his famous poem, Kafka in *The Emperor’s Message*, Dino Buzzati in his novel *The Desert of Tartars*.” What brings these influences together is not just their use of *Il Milione* as a source text but their desire to discover there an imaginary “elsewhere,” a romantic horizon that fades as the world becomes, in Calvino’s words, “more and more uniform (and for the worse)” (179).
